YOU CRY NOT ALONE
Dear One- You cry not alone
For my tears fall with Yours.
And I pray that You will let me share
The awesome burden of this sorrow You bear. You see the path that's now Yours
The way that You must go
Has been mine for a long time
Long enough for me to know: That God truly loves us all
That our sorrow is His as well
It is not His will that we suffer
But that we strengthen and prevail
