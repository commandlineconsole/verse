PROSPERITY
There is nothing to fear
except fear itself
what is fear
but a thought
If you live in the moment
how can you fear
thoughts are creative
why think fearful thoughts
why think with your head
think with your heart
if heart is true
so will your thoughts be
a strong heart
is full of courage
opposite of fear
be strong full of courage
overcome yourself
and let fear vanish
live with the golden rule
there will be no fear
treat others as
you would want them to treat you
dont put fear in your kids
let them flourish
with courage and a beautiful heart
