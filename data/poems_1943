VALENTINE LOOKING FORWARD
Looking forward to this romantic day
Planning thought of this day
To make it a special memory
Lover happily planning for tonight
To surprise to make this memory forever last
We both talk planed and to surprise
A candle light dinner I make
Getting down table looking for the lighter
Legs apart lighting fires
Yummy very nice my food and drinks
Is no as delicious and juices down the table
Darling, you ready for the last course
Honey on the stick
Down below hidden under the table
Hurry before it going cold
Make me get ready
To be your superman
Spanking you naughty nurse
Hope dream fantasy all come truth
Be ready get down on it
Happy Valentines ÔÅä
