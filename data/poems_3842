'IN MY FATHER'S HANDS'
You ask me how I cope with life as it is
I simply turn to you and say
It is in my Father’s hands
For it is he alone who my every
Care fully understands
I may fall beneath my heavy load
I may cry and sometimes feel alone too
But it is then that I am reminded
To place all my cares
In my Father’s hands
My hurts I
Give to God who can
Mend all that is broken apart
All my cares are in my Father’s hands
You don’t have to remain sad
Feeling hopeless or alone
For you too only need to
Place all of your cares
In the Father’s hands!
