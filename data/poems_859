JOY OR NO JOY
Joy is extension of happiness
It erupts when you have some new trace
Cheeks turn into red and shine the face
Of course with blessings and grace
It has nothing to do with any of the worldly things
It can be linked to happening or any of the things
You may be riding very high with emotions
You will try to run with speed and straight way come to motion
You slip in to dreamy land and wonder
There may be many questions to think and ponder
The clouds have struck making loud thunder
You must thank almighty and sincerely surrender
Joy, happiness, gladness all bear same symptoms
It is coming in life but great struggle and that too seldom
Everybody is not lucky enough to realize in their prime age
It will come very late or till they have reached old age

You are elated with joy when see the old acquaintance
You feel happiness when get the fruit without any pretence
It is great joy when you get message through sentence
It can send happy waves and at the same time can make you tense
There is no restriction for joy to be felt
How the fragrance is experienced and smelt?
How do we react when our dear once is traced and restored?
How sudden appearance of friend on scene makes us fresh when felt so bored?
We never feel unhappiness even when undergoing hardship
There is new flavor and closeness in newly developed friendship
It has all got some angle of joy and hidden pleasure
How can we ignore it when it is bound to give joy for sure?
I once asked my mother why she is having tears
When there was no matter for her to feel sad or bear?
She laughed at me and laughed out the at the topic
She said even in sadness it was mater of great joy with logic
The soldiers celebrate it with joy when ceasefire is declared
They do not enjoy when war is declared or tension is flared
It is not the time to express emotions but only to be with it
It can be had any time with or without any occasion to celebrate
I will be visibly moved when there is eruption of complete joy
It is common for, all irrespective of anything, to enjoy
Who know when it may come make us cry or burst into laughter?
I shall feel anything in it and even look smarter
