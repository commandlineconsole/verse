PASSION NEVER GOES OUT OF FASHION
Dare to live with passion
Don't fear repercussion
Don't remain silent
When there is discussion
You can't please everyone anyway
Say what you feel
Feel what you say
Live with passion
Passion opens the door
Kicks down the walls
Shouts through the halls
Picks the lowly off the floor
Has the audacity to try a little more
The world is prone to change
But passion never goes out of fashion
