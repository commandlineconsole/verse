THREE GODS BEST AVOIDED
Power, pleasure and fame are three Gods best avoided
Power for leading only to its own corruption
And denial of death where power ends.
Pleasure for its involution upon the self
Where freedom lies in finding others
The self a false center.
Fame for ephemeral lure
To those deprived of love's true nourishing milk
Easily forgetting that ax murderers
Have fame to no avail.
Power, pleasure and fame are three Gods best avoided.
