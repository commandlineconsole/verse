HEAT OF A WOMAN
The heat of a woman rising in lust
To bring flames to life turning men to dust
The heat that can burn, scorch and sear
When ever the man gets to near
But if a man survives the flames
The passion she shows will drive him insane
Locked in a timeless ecstasy
With no escape none he can see
Would he want to run away?
Diving in deeper with his soul he must pay
Of all the passions of women unbound
Itâ€™s the passion of lust that brings men down
