FEAR
Never fear your emotions they mean you no harm
It is the protective barrier we place around it that causes the fear
Fear one will break through and see the beauty of the inside
Full of warmth and wanting to give but also receive
A love for a friend or the deep passion of a mate
Not to be used or abused
Some find this in their life’s
Others die or age dreaming ….
of that one love
Fear never takes chances
It stays hidden and lonely
then dies from lonely regrets
Fear no more
Open to love’s flow
And sink or drown
At least we tried and leave no regrets
