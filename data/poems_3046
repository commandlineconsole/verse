NO MORE SORROW
Laughter and sorrow
Together as one
Satin and silk
The moon and the stars
Are so bright in the night
Fluffy clouds like cotton candy
Sweet and light
Frogs singing in the air
Life has it's up's and down's
Big balloons and silly clowns
Children playing running wild
This beautiful sound is so profound
Laughter and sorrow
Together no more
Live life to it's fullest
No more sorrow like before
