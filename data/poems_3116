MEASURES OF SORROW
Fire surges across the uncovered plains of reflection:
water rolls along slowly
mirrowing measures of sorrow.
As my trembling body shakes of uttering sadnes
drawn onto my still plastered face...
Hopes as cold as the winter skies
brings out a smell of burning red coal;
oh cries measures of sorrow:
where has my path of happiness
led me?
Hopes flutter by with wings of desire.
Fire brings in warmth
and curls lone figures into -
balls of snow
hurling across the uncovered plains of reflection.
My kindered heart is broken
burned by the fire surge
across the uncovered plains of reflection -
love envelops me? !
takes me into the heart
of a lone person
and the balls of sorrow uncurl...
inflicting measures of sorrow?
Into measures of love?
Into the heart of the unknown sullen
world of fear combining love in its mind.
