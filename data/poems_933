DANCING
Dancing
Moving
The body
Shuffling the feet
Shaking the torso
To the drum's lively beat
With hands, in the
The air,  while
Manuvering across
The floor
With some people beginning
dancing
Just as entering
The door
Oh, how invigorating
For, I danced a little bit more,
As I look around
I see that
Iam no longer
The only person
On the  lighted dance floor
Joy, joy, joy
Everybody is
Dancing
