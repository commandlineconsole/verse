OBSEQUIES
I stand alone under the heavy sky
Wild winds whipping my hair
Bringing tears to my eyes
But I do not care
Memories of you writhe around me
Collide and shatter in the air
Lost to fractured esprit
But I do not care
Wordlessly I fall upon my knees
Unshed tears of despair
Wishing you could've heard my plea
But I do not care
Never more shall my heart hold worth
After laying my soul bare
To this barren mound of earth
But I do not care
For in this berth
You are already there
