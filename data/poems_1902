A QUESTION OF MORALITY
Surprise! Surprise!
Another banker lies.
The people he robs
Of their wealth and jobs,
Are left to wonder,
to ask how they,
Have to, for years,
To continue to pay,
Whilst the high placed
Thieves walk away,
With the fruits of their
Deception and theft.
What does this tell us
About our world?
Is there any morality left?
