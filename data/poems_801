CITY OF JOY
Rich in culture
Vast in structure
Proudly
Boasts of legacy
Which
At times
Overweighs
Its underbelly
In tandem?
Yes
Think its denizens
Times of yore
With present.
City of joy
So much enjoyed
Joy, Joy and Joy
Enjoy
The ‘vicious’ cycle
Ganges to Hooghly
And the Bay
Look, beyond
The hay
Which has turned grey.
