CAN IT BE ALL TO ME
can it be all to me,
the fortunes i do see.
they appear to me free
for my pleasure to be
so sky-scraping with glee.
the pleasure is so sweet,
no effort what a feat
to have all this neat,
cheers up my mood's heat,
builds my life complete.
that sight is a treat,
wonderful and deep
for my soul to reap
all glories in heap
for gladness to keep.
to bright change a leap.
