A FINE PAIR WE
a fine pair we
you, with lack of passion trust
I, with love balanced on edge.
could you but understand
passion, once sparked
takes on a life all its own
constantly growing and breathing love fire
like an erotic shimmering golden dragon
could I but accept
the simplicity and elegance
of your desire
because it just is.
something akin to the sun
it doesn't ever leave
it just disappears, because it must
oh yes dearest heart
a very fine pair we.
