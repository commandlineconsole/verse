WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME
My mind is longing for love,
A love my heart just found.
Words will not describe!
The emotions I feel inside.
When we are together,
I need to hold you close.
Heart to mind, or lips to lips.
I love your smile,
your sexy charm,
Your valiant walk,
your long flowing hair,
All these things sets alarm.
To each day I walk alone,
No one can fill my heartâ€¦ your home.
I think about you all damn day,
But mostly when I lie awake.
I never dreamt much in the past,
Now I do and it's for you.
I will stand by your side,
Through thick and all,
To see that gorgeous smile,
That always makes me fall.
When you think you have nothing left,
I SWEAR to you, I'll be left.
Your gentle lips and your beautiful glow,
An angel I have, from head to toe.
I know these words,
my heart has shown,
To you I vow these words alone.


Love,
Me
