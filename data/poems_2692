DEEP FREEZE FEELINGS OF INFINITE SADNESS
Stuck in deep freeze feelings of
infinite sadness – sunk so deep
it cannot be brought to the surface
to be faced and maybe overcome
Sadness about something out of my
league, a thousand fathoms deep,
therefore I have no right to be
concerned about it, no right to
Lament in my pain and distress;
a sadness that stays in my deepest
psyche, manifesting in recurrent
nightmares and chronic fatigue
In my experiencing shock upon
learning the tabloids suspect Angie
of being ill – and that President
Mbeki’s positive comments
To President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
remarks that Africa’s culture leaves
no room for progress; are seen
as a racist slant by Africans –
A sadness I am not allowed,
but that puts my feelings in
deep freeze…
