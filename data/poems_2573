SADNESS INTO ONE HEART
Sadness into one Heart
as child we look up to our
elders we teach from them
watch the steam a rose bloom
that is how a child bring up
to watch the sadness of child
bring tears to the parents
we shine for a while now these
days we watch our babies grow
up but some children are still
a child them as they still babies
themselves child heart beats
little heart wonder how there
future holds when you walk outside
all I saw is buggies everywhere
to see the sadness of a child
is not ready to be having a baby
on themselve prayers go out
to them and strenth they would have
sadness by a child and a parent
