ONLY JOY
Here they are, I’ve brought them.
I’ve tied them up and bound them.
My heart breaks within me
But I consider it only joy.
Here my dreams, they are finished.
Mine no more – they are Yours.
Though they weep at my abandon,
I consider it only joy.
Here the hopes I had created,
Pictures I painted in the past.
It feels like my soul is ripping,
But I consider it only joy.
Here I lay my ambitions,
Yesterday I treasured them dear.
And though I still love, cherish them,
I consider it only joy.
Here I stand raw and unfettered,
My dreams of the world left behind.
You are my new dream and treasure,
And I consider it only joy.
