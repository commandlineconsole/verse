IF MY DEARLY BELOVED...
If my dearly beloved chooses
being harsh to lousy admirers
who cares, as long as
she's gentle towards me.
If my dearly beloved chooses
to look not in the eyes
of lousy admirers
who cares, as long as
she looks into my eyes.
If my dearly beloved spits
in the faces of lousy admirers
who cares, as long as
she kisses my face.
If my dearly beloved turns down
proposals by lousy admirers
who cares, as long as
she accepted my proposal.
If my dearly beloved keeps
a lousy admirer waiting
for hours at her gate
who cares, as long as
she accepts me in.
If my dearly beloved chooses
to listen not to flattery
from lousy admirers
who cares, as long as
she listens to mine.
If my dearly beloved chooses
to keep a lousy admirer
kneeling in the sun
who cares, as long as
she makes me stand.
If my dearly beloved offers
a handshake to lousy admirers
who cares, as long as
she gives me a hug.
