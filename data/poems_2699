BLACK SNOW
Winter has come
He'll show us
What will come upon
The forever lasting signs
Flowers shall wilt
And never grow again
Trees and us have died in Winter's wrath
He have only hallowness
Filled with dread
Does he have darkness in his heart?
Is pain all he seeks?
Yet he have sadness in his eyes
Is pain all he seeks?
We shall wilt
And never grow again
We died upon Winter's wrath
We shall filled his hallowness
Filled with only dread
But, Winter's tears fallen upon us
Expecting ice to stab thee
Cold as his heart we have expected
For coming at us
Is the cold snow of his sadness
His sadness is greater than his hate
His loss is greater than our pain
He murdered us for a reason
Probably he knows that Spring will never revive us
Spring have died with the Earth and tribe
Sadness in his heart?
The pain is what he has left
Yet there is greif in his blackened heart
Is salvation all he seeks?
His pain will finally fall apart
His heart is broken
And forever more, he will never have love again
Spring have died in human's wrath
For his heart is hallow
His tears shall bury us
In black snow
