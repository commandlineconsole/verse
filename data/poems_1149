SONNET, SWEET MUSIC TO HEAR
Sweet music to hear in bright summer’s day
In delights and joys of wonderful themes
Where each new bud into new color seems
Coming through bouquet’s bed in its new earth lay
Dreaming of new spring in concords of sounds
Unions married in the harmonious blue skies
Each feeling confound in spring and summer tries
Going sweetly together in its joyful rounds
Strings of tunes in new daybreak rising
Filling every day in its truest delight
All in one pleasing with its surprising
Through the finding moments to the eve night
Songs of many joys growing in its splendor
When days are brightly in its truest tender
