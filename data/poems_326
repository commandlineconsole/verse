REMAINING SILENT IS NOT LOVE
Love is unafraid to speak
Love is bold
Love is Truth
Love perseveres
Love has no bounds
Love knows not fear
So love often is the voice that points out an offense
Love is often the voice that stands up and says 'NO! '
Love is the voice that battles injustice
Love is the voice you wish to turn off because the truth hurts
Often the very one we run from..is the one who loves us most
But love forgives
Love will take you back in
And when you know Love your heart will mend
And you will smile again
