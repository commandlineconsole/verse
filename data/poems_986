THE BELL OF JOY
Let me be the first one to ring
The bell of joy and wirth it bring
The message of hope, love and care
To show how much yoy are dear
I wish you joy when you are sad
And everything looks dull and bad
And I hope to see around you love
That is God sent gift of heaven above
And hope that is ever in life
You need my love and support to survive
Then I'll be the first one to bring
Joy's bell to make your heart sing.
