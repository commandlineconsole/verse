FLOW OF PAIN
Happiness is where?
Happiness does someone care
Sadness is hard to bare
Is it right or fare
To feel that way?
Day by day
Life goes on with blues
I'm not alone
There are a few
A overhead fan keeps me cool
Inside I'm flowing with moods
Sadness to gladness
Seems a tower away
I'm down under
Looking through
All I feel is blues
A broken flow of pain
Happiness is to gain
I have awareness in vain
I need the tools.
