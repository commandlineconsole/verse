WHY WOULD YOU?
I go thru life
only trying to hide
the pain i feel inside
everytime i try to walk away
my mind takes it right back again
and as i sit here hurting
You don't care
I tried to avoid
I tried to reconnect
You don't care
I Hurt
I Cry
I'm tired of keeping it inside
But you won't know
You don't care
I don't wish you harm
I don't wish you pain
I just want you out of my head, but
You don't care
I want to cry
I want to die
Just to stop me from returning to these thoghts
But it doesn't matter
You don't care
