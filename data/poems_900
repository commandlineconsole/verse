A SONG OF JOY
An emotion that keeps
The heart carefree,
Bubbling up inside of me.
Once you feel it, you’d agree;
The joy inside of me.    [
I feel it as I go along.
It brightens the spirit
And makes it strong.
Life enriched—is prolonged
For the joy in me.
Though such joy you cannot see,
Overwhelming it can be.
Full, and rich, and esprit—
That’s the joy in me.
The joy inside of me.
