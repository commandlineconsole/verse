HAPPY ANNIVERSARY MOM & DAD
Years fly on the wings of time
Riding on joy and sorrows rhyme
Searching for words that sounds right
That can bring the hope of delight
Now so much time has gone by
Leaving nostalgic memories high
And giving us the gift so true
That includes mom and daddy too
Yes sure i'm thankful today
To god for giving us in his way
So much gift of blessings above
To fill our lives with pleasure's love
And because it's your anniversary day
That's why I wish may the way
Of your life be filled with bright
Happiness to bring you both delight.
