(AFRICA POEMS)  WE CARE FOR OUR OWN
We are united in our resolve
We are pushing back the borders of
Tribal conflict and ethnic chauvinism
We are one in body and soul
We are determined to rid our motherland
Of the dubious title of the most undisputed
Backward leaning continent of them all
Our friends who do not want to exploit
This vast sprawling land for the nefarious
Activity of personal gain...give us a chance
We love this land.We care for our own
We love Africa and her mighty rivers
And her great herds of beautiful animals
And the trees and the curing herbs
We care for our own
And perhaps it is good we don't have the
Great fishing ships and the submarines
And things otherwise there would be no fish
In our oceans
We care for our own
And we want to tell the others to stop
Diverting their oil spills to our coastline
We care for our own
And we would like you our brothers to stop
Slaughtering our marvelous rhino their
Horns cannot increase your sexual potency
Visit our continent not in the bad spirit
We care for our own
And we want to end the horrors of child
Soldiers and child sexual slaves
We care for our own
We want progress and not regression
And we want the bad rulers jailed and not
Pardoned and pensioned off as millionaires
We care for our own
And we want to see the food we manufacture
On our tables and not stolen out of our
Mouths and recycled back to us from overseas
And we want to be the exporters of our own
Culture and not see our music on our shelves
Paraded as something new
We care for our own
And we want democracy to work for the people
Because what we have now is a fake given to us
With the bad intention of enriching the few among
Us who're immoral who serve the organizations
That are controlled by the world powers
We care for ourselves
And we must look inward and ask ourselves
If we are right to neglect the elderly among us
And throw stones at the mentally disturbed
And we must be humane to each other
And when we sing or cry or pray or make love
We must perform these sacred duties with true
Love to show that we care for our own
