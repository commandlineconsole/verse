A GENTLY CARESS
I give to you a gentle kiss
Enticing passions in showy assist
Desirous bodies in lusting want
An applauding essence,
in justly confront
You are as a ripening flower
luxuriant in fleshy bloom
Unfolding pedals layer,
in bearing assume
A heightening passion,
in sexual admire
Full of vigor,
in suggestive desire
An extravagant pleasure,
in luxurious wallow
Pretentious hunger,
in passionate swallow
I have come upon you,
in lavish shower
To gently caress,
your wanting blush in
Brightening devour
