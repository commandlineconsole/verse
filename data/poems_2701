FRIENDLESS AGAIN
If you always get sadness then I guess happiness was never meant to be yours
All that we can do is accepting sadness as our reality.
Sadness is the reality and nobody is your friend
This basic truth hurts and now I really am starting to feel it.
Cannot change the way life functions as that is just life
A life which has nothing other than suffering in it
We suffer, only suffer as happiness is only an illusion
At least for me, happiness never lasts
Since, whenever I try to be happy
Happiness gets angry from me.
Now as I remain forever alone
Everything, is going to be sadness and pain
Such pain is never going to heal since I am friendless again.
