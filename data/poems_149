LOVE ME LOVE ME
ove me love me say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
I'm I'm ready to go
dropp dropp hot stop the eye lock
I must be dreaming go hit the alarm clock
Under the lights, coming alive, she's thriller tonight
ay ay ay
One dance, two dance is not enough
You got that glow on the dot so Im not giving up
I'm reading your mind you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it hide it
Love me love me say youre gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
Love me love me say you're gonna love me
Dont leave me out on the floor
I'm saying woah-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me no-oh-oh-oh
Love me love me say you're gonna love me

Love me love me, lo-love me lo-love me
Love me love me, lo-love me
I'm ready to go
Cant stop, wont stop the party rock
You got that red of you're lips, sweet, like Betty Crock-ER
So call a doc-TER
Cause someone needs to take your temperature you're getting hotter
All of the lights, coming alive, she's thriller tonight
I'm reading your mind you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it hide it
When I rock, you roll
You're loosing control
And if you got that feeling throw your
hands up in the air
Love me love me say youre gonna love me
I know youre ready to go
Love me love me say youre gonna love me
Don't leave me out on the floor
I'm saying woah -oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me no-oh-oh-oh
Love me love me say youre gonna love me
I'm I'm I'm ready to go

Dont say goodbye cause we just said hello
say your gonna love me girl cause I need to know

Love me love me say youre gonna love me
I know youre ready to go
Love me love me say youre gonna love me
Dont leave me out on the floor
I'm saying woah -oh-oh-oh
Dont tell me no-oh-oh-oh
Love me love me say youre gonna love me
