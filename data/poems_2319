TEARS IN MY THROAT
For years
tears have been behind my eyes
forced back
by a promise
A childhood
filled with tears
blocking
future tears all together
Choking on depression
pressure building
making my whole body hurt
making me hate everything around me
A fire in my stomach
making those tears boil
turning my self pity
into pure anger
It feels like
if I could cry
just once
I could find love
Cupid's arrow
erupting in flames from the heat of anger
anger fueled by depression
grown through time
Maybe one day
love can be my sheers
tears steaming down my face
allowing me to find peace
