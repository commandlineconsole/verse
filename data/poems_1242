THE WILDEST CATS
The wildcats wander at night.
Frightened not by absence of light-
“Dusk is a dance of dark delight! ”
They sing, they sing, as claws unite.
While perched at one unearthly height,
Their silhouettes look all alike.
While perched at one unearthly height,
They sing, they sing, as claws unite:
“ Dusk is a dance of dark delight! ”
Frightened not by absence of light-
The wildcats wander at night.
