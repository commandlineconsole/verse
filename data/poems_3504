NOT MORTAL ANYMORE
Would my demise really be cause
For your concern
Or are you saying that
To play your face
I mean the Queen
Must always keep her court
Is that just your way
Of keeping me?
But would you read the lines
In between lines
Would you notice
The intricate I love yous’
That remain unspoken
By me
This time around
But surely you must know
The way I’m still a jester
Only in your court
The champion
Hidden away from prying eyes
Even your own
Cause would you manage
To survive
If my armor curved
Like my body
Somehow I know
You wouldn’t
But your actions proved that
To me
To the world
Before
So why waste
Life
On a second try
No
I think this time
I’ll let you call the shots
I’ll play indifferent
Cause deep down
I know this charade
Like I know the Gods
You’ve left behind
For mortal toys
Human fears
And mortal years
That you waste
On your foolish games
With winning words
I don’t want to understand
Worlds I don’t want
You to concern yourself with
Anymore
