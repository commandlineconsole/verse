GLOOMY MUSIC
Try to wipe the gloom
From your life's days
And bring in it my dear
Joy and pleasure's way
And know that gloomy music
Make things feel all bad
And change all nice things
From things that're all glad
And bring in it my dear
The pleasure of joy 'n fain
That can now wipe out
All that brings you pain
Because life is very long
And you need in it too
Nice and joyous days
And a better view.
