FLAWLESS ANGER
he knows shes angry with him,
but he can not be angry with her,
she is beautiful,
and even when in anger,
she still remains flawless,
a beauty no less,
and no more than an angel,
so perfect,
and passionate,
he can not be angry with her,
even if her anger rises with no reason,
because he loves her,
and he knows she loves him anyways,
he promised to love her forever,
he had no reason for that,
and yet he had every reason,
she is his reason,
for love,
and he knows with him,
she will make it last,
for even when in anger,
her beauty is flawless,
on the inside and out.
