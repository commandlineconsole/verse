JOHN SHEA
He is indeed a delighting super cool bard
He oughtta get an entertainment's award
I enjoy reading his fun poetry
and he wrote one swell one just for me!
Like a laughing knight of chivalry.
And his comments leave me grinning profusely
He's nice to have around on the site
With my name he penned a poem to delight
Thankyou kind troubadour
my Eastern hats off to you for sure!
