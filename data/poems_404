THE PASSION BURNS
When times are tough
And you feel like you had enough
You think there is nothing more for you
But listen to these words I'm telling you


There is a passion that burns inside of us
Even through the darkest days
When you feel like you want to give up
The fire of passion burns inside of you


That passion is your heart
Telling you don't give up
In this life
Don't give up the fight
You will live just hold on
I have been there
It isn't fun
But the thing with everyone
You have a passion burning inside of you that will
Never ever be put out
