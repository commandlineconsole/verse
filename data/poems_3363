EARLY DAYS ***** DRY TEARS MOURNERS
Cry me
not
tears dropp
are in vain
wipe the pain
weep no more
i have no pity
you all concerns
look not
so mournful the past
it returns
no more
bygone is bygone
tears are in naught
i lost now pity
you all concerns
noboy i blame
if i fall upon
the thorns of life
again and again
your tears are in  vain
