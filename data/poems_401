PASSION
Passion is something you see
Its something you do
Its somethin you are
Passion is a feeling that makes you laught
Makes you mad
Makes you sad
Passion is a word that can't be defined
But to me its something i found in a guy
Maybe its his looks, maybe its his touch
That makes me love him so much
Thats makes me love him so much
Maybe his smile, maybe his style
Thats makes me want to scream for a while
And if you read this baby
I just want to let you know
That i would never, ever let you go
Passion is something i feel for you
And if you want to know
I love you!
