WINTER MINDS
When drifting through windstorms
Leave your umbrella behind
Don’t overreach yourself
The bar has been raised
Windmills have never been slower
Though the weather now is horrific
I surprise myself by feeling sorry for you
It’s raining like crazy
But the sky is clearer
And the cold breeze feels warmer
When sent from one’s iced mind
Every snowflake melts for its nature
Floating through storms, enjoying every bit
I surprise myself by feeling sorry for you
The main road is now frozen
Signs are leading to other directions
No need for wandering through slippery paths
Expectations let down and carried away
Windstorms will keep on blowing
In vain would be to go for what’s not enough
Hence I surprise myself by feeling sorry for you.
