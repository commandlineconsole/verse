MISTAKE
life is a spiral a spiral of dispare we have no idea
where we are heading and how long it will take
the only thing we know is that we will die
i used to care care about life care about people
now there is nothing worth caring for is this life is this
what its become is this the start of my life thinking about death
waiting for the day when it accually comes
whats there worth waiting for i have nothing now and nothing when i die
so i bit you a good bye
