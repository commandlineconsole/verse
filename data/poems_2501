BROKEN SPIRIT
To me he is the world
His words soft and forgiving
I broke his spirit
I tore his heart
From where it lies
The anger in his eyes
Tells a story of pain
Past and present
His voice shaky and strained
Under the weight of the world
The weight I placed
On this perfect soul
The anger unleashed
The pain relived
Another Scar
Another story
On this soldiers
Weary spirit
