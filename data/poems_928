THOUGHTS OF FRIENDSHIP
Friendship is a noble task
Friendship is a flower's flask
That spread all over the smile
And give joy to others for miles
For thoughts of friendship is dear
As it is a passion so rare
That blooms the flower of joy
For all and let them enjoy
The sweetness that's hidden in it
And emit joy's rays bit by bit.
