WOULD I?
If life would leave today
and night drapes over me,
would I remember the pleasure
of loving you so free?
If my eyes would close
on a world so bright,
would I remember the pleasure
of you - a beautiful sight?
If my mind would grow dim
on the things I knew,
would I remember the pleasure
of sharing them with you?
If all these things would happen
and I shall be without,
would I remember the pleasure
of what love was all about?
