TO CARE
Three dimensional care is the only way for spiritual consideration
Anything less causes denial
The direction the right path
Be humble though fortune may crumble
Empathic scheme is not a plan
Listen and understand
Lack of merit returns blessed grace
We care
Do we know how
In a dimension affinity is not bound
So we should inspire to reach a higher plane of thought
Rather than to rely on the morals we are taught
To care far beyond and accept things to be gone
To be deemed alternate and tragically go on
You have shown the true meaning of the word care
