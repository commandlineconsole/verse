WHY ME MY ANGEL
My Angel has brought me great trouble.
In and out of Hospital I go.
With sadness and burns and soft tissue scars heartburn and dread as we leave this mess with crying and screaming.
With Sorrow, sadness and death of sick sick people and horrible horrible feelings that will, leave you screaming with great fear  so think how lucky you are that your not one of them but its a shame one of them is me.
