WISDOM
Through all the years I've been alive
Things still take me by surprise.
No matter how bizarre
No matter how much I think I know,
Something still comes to surprise you.
All you can do is handle as it comes,
Help guide those that have asked you
And help for the best of all of them
You must keep your head held high,
Your spirit in tact,
And your mind sharp.
No matter what takes you by surprise,
Its how you handle it that makes it the most.
