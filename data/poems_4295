FEAR
I sat shivering in my bed at night,
And mistook everything as ghost in my sight,
I could not challenge my fear for a fight,
And I was so eagerly waiting for a ray of light.
Fear is powerful than myself,
Even it modifies dreams to nightmares,
It is a dangerous shelf,
For everything it dares.
Everyone is afraid of fear,
Everyone is popular with fear,
Everyone is often met by fear,
And everywhere, fear, fear, fear!
It grows in night,
Whereas dies or reduces in the day,
Itâ€™s an international, internal and unapproachable criminal;
And it does not allow anyone simply on their own way.
