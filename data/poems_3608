DAYS COME AND GO
Days come and go by as year pass
We excel with time and show the class
Life is somewhere struck in between reality
Failure some where and success only with capability
Duty and obligation to form real life test
We carry on with good will and offer the best
We aim for best in life but often marred by development
Peace is threatened at home with suspicious movement
So many might have lost life while defending nation
Many more might have died on some other occasion
They might have belonged directly to us or caused concern
Yet humanity demands that we all pray for their peaceful sojourn
We know it is sad as well as joyous event
We would certainly go in for enjoyment
We shall remember for all those staying far away
For our cause and waiting for return all the way
Christmas tree must bring their hopes live this year
Let drums beat and music please the ears
Let sky illuminate with thousands of more stars
Not with crackers but gun’s indication of no wars
Let it brighten our souls with divine light
Stop the bellicose thoughts leading to fight
Let us not involve in who is wrong or right
Let the sound sleep take over us all in night
May be we are meant for here with some useful mission
Let today flow our conscious with free admission
No to any thought for causing concern or harm
Let the good wishes flow with welcome warm
It may then be desire on each and every individual
The feeling and grave concerns can’t be taken as casual
Our future life hinges clearly on peace and good will
Else we may witness many innocent deaths and gruesome killings
I wish Christmas tree to glow more
Every face must think kind therefore
One innocent smile may take away all the worries
We have the burden and responsibility to carry
