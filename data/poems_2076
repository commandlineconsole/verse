FAMILY LOVE
Tis the season
To spread joy and cheer
I grin as I take part in this season
My family always squabbled
About every little detail
But now they are silent in
Joyous harmony
I took them by surprise
As I brought in that so large pie
Imagine to my delight
They enjoyed a slice
I made this pie just for my family
Tis the season after all
They begged me to tell them
Of the unique taste
That tasted so fine
I told them it was a secret ingredient
Though they begged me to share
I held my tongue
Least to ruin the surprise
My aunt was the first
her eyes growing large
She suddenly realized
What that ingredient was
Since she had used it before
On her poor late husband
Her cry of surprise
Made everyone jump
They soon realized
Regrettably to late
I smiled slyly
They yelled curses at me
But I just smiled
I told them simply
That I wanted to spread some holiday cheer
The holidays are supposed to be filled with happiness
But this family has never had some
Well soon there will be no more arguing
No more fighting
They should thank me
Well at least the neighbors will
