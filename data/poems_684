FEELING INJURED
Feeling Injured
Wind from the darkness is silent
Thereâ€™s nothing but passion and sad
Fierce my heart
Sensitive words was injured by the heavy mind
Who streaming from the wound is not the dead blood
But the lively hope
Passion is the flame burning in the ice
But in reality dream can not wonder
In the place where it was born
Mind, the weak in shivering is still dreaming
How can he enter his paradise from reality the hell
