DAY BY DAY GONE
Day by day gone
Flowers of time
Those drifting seeds on
Of blooms once in prime
The bouquets that give
Pleasure each day
As we with them live
Until its winter’s play
Love songs in key
Of nature’s summer long
Until again they’re to be
For darker colder song
Like everything is going
And falling to dust
So is autumn glowing
In all its pleasure rust
Till days of winter cold
That comes soon thru
And blanching can’t hold
The colors once true
Withering times and leaves
All shall be forgotten
Though our longing grieves
Leaves - those lie now rotten
