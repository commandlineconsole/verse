LOVE...
LOVE…
I LOVE THE CONCEPT OF LOVE
TO BE IN LOVE
TO FEEL LOVE
BUT I HAVE ABUSED THE WORD OF LOVE
USED THE ONE WHO LOVED
I LOVE THE FEELING OF LOVE
THE DEPTH OF LOVE
BUT I HAVE RUINED THE EMOTION OF LOVE
THE SENSITIVITY OF LOVE
I LOVE TO BE TOUCHED BY LOVE
MADE BY LOVE
MAKE LOVE
BUT I HAVE MISTREATED THE CARESS FROM LOVE
THE KISS OF LOVE
I LOVE TO LOVED BY LOVE
BOUND BY LOVE
BUT I HAVE LOST THAT LOVE
I BROKE MY LOVE
AND NEGLECTED OUR LOVE
I LOVE TO PICTURE LOVE
PAINT LOVE
BUT I HAVE DRIED LOVE
STOLEN LOVE
I LOVE TO WALK WITH LOVE
TALK TO ME LOVE
SAY IT AGAIN LOVE
OVER AND OVER…LOVE
BUT I HAVE RAN FROM LOVE
MUTED THE WORD LOVE
AGAIN AND AGAIN…LOVE
I LOVE TO LOVE YOU STILL LOVE
FEEL LOVE
HEAR LOVE
SPEAK LOVE
LOVE ME LOVE
LOVE MY KIND OF LOVE
LOVE THIS LOVE
LOVE…LOVE…LOVE...
I AM LOVE…
