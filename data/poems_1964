SMILE OF THE TIME
It is sure possible to witness
As innumerable examples already
The struggle of some people
And with the smile of the time
Those who are condemned today
Can make a difference tomorrow
Only with their perseverance
And zeal to do a favorite act
Of surprising all the people
With their indomitable spirit
And the rare achievement shown
Today's people shall regret then
Tomorrow's shall be proud of
Yet the zeal shall be thirsty
Of achieving further heights
And above all surprising self
