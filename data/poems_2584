I WENT TO WHERE THE SADNESS IS
I WENT TO WHERE THE SADNESS IS
I went to where the Sadness is
And tried to lie down there
But no one heard my cry
And so I went far away-
To a place where there is no Sadness-
And there I simply laughed and sang all day and all night
Until the Sadness came suddenly back to me
And took me into a deeper world I did not love
From where I now write this poem happily.
