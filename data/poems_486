PASSIONS
Passions, passions, passions,
Kindled by a spark of desire.
Profound desires and emotions,
Brought to fulfillment in a fire,
With ardours the glow, the thrill,
The delirious sensations of rapture.
Eagerly enjoyed to the utmost extent,
By two people, who had the will
To love, love, love, and not repent.
