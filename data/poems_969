MY TEARS
Joy,
Anger,
Saddness,
Hope,
My tears bring different emotions,
They show my,
Inner weakness,
Who I really am,
My tears of joy,
Shows good in my life,
The happiness I see,
And the happiness of me,
My tears of anger,
The show my,
Irritation with life,
My father,
My tears of saddness,
They show darkness,
The deppression,
That consumes me,
My tears of hope,
They show my faith,
The will of going on,
And the good of people,
Joy,
Anger,
Saddness,
Hope,
My tears,
Show emotions,
My inner self,
The emotions of a Khan.
