DOES LOVE HURT?
A lot of people believe
That love is the most painful feeling
They just believe that
Love hurts
Does love hurts?
Love doesn't hurt at all
Love is the most wonderful feeling on earth
With this you feel protected
Love gives you a suiting feeling
Loves takes you to wonderful places
Who says love hurts?
Love gives you passion
Love makes you reach the stars
Love smells like freshly bloomed flowers
Love makes you swim the deepest ocean
Love makes you move mountains
Love builds bridges..
Love is Love
So you think that
Loving someone who doesn't love you back hurts?
Loving somebody who loves another hurts
Loving nobody at all hurts?
Being loved by nobody hurts?
So love does hurt?
I don't think so
Falling out of love hurts
Betrayal hurts
Not having love hurts
Love doesn't hurt
