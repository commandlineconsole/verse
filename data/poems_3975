INCONSIDERATE
Twisted, OCD, Selfish, Inconsiderate being
Not caring about anyone else
Thinking only of yourself
Irresponsible, person you are
Shirking your responsibilities
Oh how I would love to erase you
You don't know how lucky you are right now
All you think about is your money and what you can spend it on
Never once understanding what we go through to survive
The bills have to paid or else the lights get shut off
The oil runs out
Leaving us cold in the winter
But you don't care
So long as you get to spend your paycheck however you want
That's how you thrive
Not listening, not hearing, not wanting to know
Taking for granted all that I do
Not caring that there's not enough food
Why should you care? You don't have to
So long as someone else takes care of you
Takes care of the bills, buys the food
You'll continue to shirk what you should do
Never providing for us the way you ought to
Lazy Man living with me
I'm just about at the point of no more
I'm about to close the door
On our life together for I can't take much more
One day you're going to wake up alone
One day you're going to be without me
Keep being a stugatz
You'll see
Pretty soon there won't be anyone here for you to be stupid for
Because pretty soon we'll be gone
Leaving you alone to face reality
