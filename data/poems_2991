EID IS TOMORROW BUT I AM IN SORROW
In my part of the world Eid ul Fitr is tomorrow
but i have found myself in deep sorrow
I am not in sorrow because its eid
I am in sorrow because The Month of Months is going to leave.
I am in sorrow because Shaitan is about be released
I am in sorrow because of man's greed
I am in sorrow because while we feast away
Somewhere in the world,
A family is wondering whether they’ll eat the next day
I am in sorrow because as we bid farewell to Ramadan
We bid farewell as well to the lessons we learnt
I am in sorrow because we now welcome immorality
And adopt it as if it is a normality
I am in sorrow because of our ignorance
To that fact that Allah's Mercy is abundant
And Ramadan being over doesn't mean He'll stop sending His blessing
I am in sorrow because actions are judged by their endings
And the ending we plan is not the ending the month deserves
I am in sorrow because on this day we empty our reserves
We spend all our savings on extravagant celebrations
When we should be pondering on continuation
Continuation of the lifestyle we adopted during the month
Which will be difficult because Shaitan is out to hunt
So before I congratulate you on this Eid
I’ll first pray to Allah to accept you and me
I ask Allah to reward us for the few good deeds
And forgive our mountain pile of sins
I ask Allah in his infinite mercy
To grant us all Janna tul Firdausi
As our deeds alone are certainly not enough
To make us succeed on the day the dead is raised up.
I ask Allah to protect us from the whispers of Shaitan
And give us the ability to worship him more than we did during Ramadan
For not just another year but for the rest of our lives
I ask all to give us wealth enough for us to survive
But not the kind of wealth that brings us hate
And finally I ask Allah to take us from this world, only when He is satisfied with our faith
