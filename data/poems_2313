SPITE
Anger
Spite
Trusting without
Lies staring at you
Red looking about
No this isn’t the way
Yes anger can make
Anyone sway
Suspicion
Deception
Runs around
Looking at every
Corner in the dark
Mind spinning
With all this doubt
Tight inside
Words spoken
With a fight
Loss of touch
Loss of mind
Letting up
A reason not
Able this time
Count on days
To come and go
Only to know
That yes
This is ANGER
Being held
Inside………………
