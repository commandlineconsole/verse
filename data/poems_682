NOT SAINTS BUT MEN
Swaying uselessly
In the loose wind
Floating in
Finite expectancy
Of summer without end
To have a great gift
And not know it
To only fantasize
And not actualize
Except on passion
For passion's sake
Caught in spidery entanglement
Of esoteric intrigue
While flowing in consciousness
Of personal design
(Blue River, Oregon 1978)
