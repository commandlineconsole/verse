OUR HOUSE OF PRAYER
With our house surprises are certain,
The sure men who love me most are in here.
The children have no longer been ill,
And this time we have sickness.
The illness to know is too striking,
It means times of the world are changing.
This time, we call them an angel,
And this angel is deadly for our children.
The house is empty now of surprises,
For the prayers will be answered.
