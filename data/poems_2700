SADNESS
Sadness is a strong emotion,
Let out those tears.
As we cry we let out all
those hidden feelings.
At some point we must learn
to reflect on our inner self,
Never be shy to cry.
One tear dropp is for a new
starting point to express
yourself.
Two tear drops are for
letting go and releasing
those feelings and emotions
hidden within yourself.
Third tear drops are for
saying goodbye to those
mixed emotions,
To never bottle up your
sadness.
The fourth tear drops are
for congratulations to
getting closer to your inner
self.
It is always healthy to let
some sadness out,
You must remember too many
is a sign to say a prayer.
Sadness is a natural emotion,
We will learn to never keep
those tears inside too long.
A time to connect and reflect
within and on yourself,
Surround yourself with happy
thoughts.
