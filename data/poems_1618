14. LOVE IS â€“ SOME THOUGHTS! [ON LOVE A COLLECTION OF POEMS]
Love is a never-ending lane
Full of misery and pain
It is built on belief
But, often we come to grief.
Torn between duty and pleasure
Love is indeed a terrible pleasure!

* * *
Love is a searing passion
Which suspects and hopes
Sighs and smiles
Hurts and heals
All in the same breathe,
Fills and leaves it empty
All at once!
