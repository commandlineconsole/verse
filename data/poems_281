LOVING YOU
I love you, I love you
I may not always think about you
But I love you, I love you
I really do
I love you, I love you
I may not always show you
But I love you, I love you
You should know I do
I love you, I love you
I may sometimes hurt you
But I love you, I love you
I never mean to
I love you, I love you
I may never say it to you
But I love you, I love you
I always do
I always want you to be happy
Because I love you, I love you
I believe I can find the best of you
Because I love you, I love you
I never want you crying
Because I love you, I love you
I need you to be stronger
Because I love you, I love you
