PASSION
Passion
One day you wake to
Be possessed by a new passion
No resistance from me
Here we go again
Clouds obstruing my brain
Dreams come true
Shattering all my values
Gone the normality
Of traditional life
Opening up my mind
Shutting down the laws
Of this old lead life
Starting to live again
Feeling passion
Arousing in my veins
Why me why you
How did it happen
What will come next
Nothing really matters
Even though it should not be
I am possessed by a new passion
