ANGER MANAGEMENT
Anger, such a provocative topic,
Mal-aligned, ill-defined, all in time.
Just what exactly is anger?
A sequence of insult,
Repressed resentment,
Unconscious revenge,
Fantasies of aggression,
Anger really is................................
Having a sizzling, red coal,
Between the cheeks of your ass,
With a double Playtex girdle on!
Disappointing all the Adlerians,
What is the therapy?
Quit complaining about it!
Just remove it!
