FEAR OF YEMA
In me dies the fear of God.
He is to me mere a witness.
In me dies the fear of men.
Their backs are well discernable.
In me dies the fear of women
As I got rid of my shame.
In me dies the fear of dark
As I know the light as a quilt.
In me dies the fear of space,
Found alike under dome and tomb.
In me lies the fear of Time;
Yema is sighted in the yard.
Fear of Yema
Kills love of all.
[Yama is the Hindu God that terminates oneâ€™s life. Riding on a buffalo, he execute,
Without a hearing or mercy.]
