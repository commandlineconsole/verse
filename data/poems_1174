REFLECTION
Reflection cold of heart
Stares hard, with smug delight
Flash frozen face of ice
Sculpted, of sickly sight
Disheveled hair awry
Hangs limp, 'pon shadow'd face
Skin, deathly pale of hue
Product of misery's waste
Mirrored eyes of deep brown
Hidden, of heavy brow
Bare thick and lengthy lash
Share not of then, nor now
Wrinkles of wisdom's age
Lie dormant, in their depth
Face of aging disgrace
Reflects, so grossly in ept

Reflection cold of heart
Blink long, this sickly sight
Flash frozen, face of ice
Stares hard, with smug delight.
