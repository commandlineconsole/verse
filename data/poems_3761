LOVE HATE CARE
Love you from start to finish
Love you with no pushing
Love you with all my heart
Love you been hit with my dart
Hate you never such a strong word
Hate you why would I you mean the world
Hate you god no care to much
Hate you no that's mean and just dirt
Care for you I truly do
Care about you,  you don't have a clue
Care from tip to toe
Care for  you with all my heart and soul
