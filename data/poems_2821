I WILL BE HAPPY
The sadness
Drips into me
Like tears falling from my eyes
Or rain falling from the clouds.
It splatters and mixes with the spilt blood
On the bathroom floor
because I CUT myself
to help with the pain
of your passing.
BUT it doesn't help
It only brings me more pain
More sadness
More depression
And closer and closer to death.
Maybe when I am with death
I will...
Be........
Happy.................
