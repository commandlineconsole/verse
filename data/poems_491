WEDDING NOTES (PLANTA, BACOLOD)
i
from the heart
she sings
her passion to
the groom
who
surprised in
such joy
profusedly
tears fall
like pearls
on the
floor
ii
the food perhaps
fall short
the simplicity
was
enough
to quell the
longings of the heart
it was her passion
above all
that made the occasion
more
memorable
iii
w hen passions reach
the heights of
flames
when the heart burns
like
a ball of fire
we have no more words
we can offer
only bouquets of magnificent
silence
