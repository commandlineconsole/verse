THE FEAR OF ONE'S LOVED ONE LOSING IT ALL
THE FEAR OF ONE'S LOVED ONE LOSING IT ALL
The fear of one's loved one losing it all
Is the fear of oneself losing it all
Dumb and silent and helpless
Before the Hell another suffers
We weep and cry and try with all our souls
But no one can lift the weight of another-
The fear of one's loved one losing it all-
Is the understanding one oneself does not control this
And the worst may happen
While one is completely aware of it watching it trying to stop it-
The fear of one's loved one losing it all
The fear of being lost.
