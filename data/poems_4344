Success is a state of mind
It is not bound to anything
It is the act of doing, not attaining
and moving forward with purpose
How often do we feel stuck
Out of place
Too tied to our circumstance to the point
of frustration
I sincerely hope this does not occur
for no amount of doing will set you free
Success is drive
is verve
is passion
is lack of fear
Now fear
fear is a different beast entirely
It is foolish to fear loosing everything
but also foolish to believe
you have to loose everything
to gain something
then again
sometimes loss is necessary
but be not afraid
for there is nothing in life
you can loose
that you cannot overcome
and something will never loose itself from you
if you treat it with passion
for passion is not given
rather it is lived
and felt
and reciprocated
it is what creates success
and demolishes fear
be bold
for if you are not
happiness is weak
be driven
for if you are not
your life will go nowhere
and you will blame everything
because of your weakness
fear not
because fear does not exist
outside your own mind
and lastly
above anything else
love
and give love
and spread love
and most of all
despite every corner that
tells you otherwise
believe in love
because sometimes belief
is far greater
than any thing
you could ever hope to encounter
