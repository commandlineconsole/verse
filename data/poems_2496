KEEPING A COOL HEAD
Tis not noble to act on rage
No matter what your human age
Self control is the blessing for you
Stay above those nasty few
Know within you have the power
Repeat this and your foe will cower
For as anger rages in their soul
You find peace from staying whole
A nasty word said in attack
Takes twice as long to take it back
Violence shown through physical abuse
Will be your punishment in the noose
So head my words and meditate
Focus on your inner state
Itâ€™s not worth the damage to you
Let my message get you through
On a final note I must just say
I cope with anger every day
Using tactics listed above
I end the problem by sharing love
