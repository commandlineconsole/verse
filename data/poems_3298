TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
To whom it may concern, I've got something to say
but no one seems to listen, no one seems to stay.
To whom it may concern, Will you please tell them to stop?
the way they make me feel, only makes me drop.
To whom it may concern, they tear me to pieces,
and when they do it to me, their happiness releases.
To whom it may concern, will you tell them how I feel,
often they forget, that my feelings are quite real.
I do not mean trouble, but they need to someday learn,
I just thought id mentioned it to whom it may concern.
