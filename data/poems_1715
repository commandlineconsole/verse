OUR EYES AND EARS
Yet we revise our papers for the pleasure
Of a single marriage, the best secret.
Pleasant places and airspaces shall head
The hair of a sudden astonishing thing.
A slight comfort rewarded us when sold
To eastern eyes, the eyes were hers.
They were ears as well, ears to hide as well,
Forming our basics and finer facts, too distinct.
The pleasure of a menace retells distinction
That seem ill and forgotten, but never.
