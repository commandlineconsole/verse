LIVE WITH PLEASURE
With grace, happiness and pleasure
Learn here to treasure
The joy that is hidden dear
Inside the very small layers
Of the rides of the life
With which we here survive
And learn to accept it
With the challenges bit
And try to break down wall
And hurdles whether big or small
And be the winner of life
And learn here to survive
With grace, fain and pleasure
For these are life's treasure.
