OBSESSION
You are my growing pain,
My pleasure,
Seeping into my bones,
As if you were an arrogant
Flower,
Rooting my calcium
Dry.
But with great nature
Brings beautiful
Scenery
That envelopes even the most
Brutal pains,
And the most
Pleasureful pleasures,
And confides them into a firm,
Grasp of alleviation and sorrow.
A perfect comparison...
If only this obsession
Wouldn't have
Killed
Me,
Then maybe this would be...
Right.
