SORROWED TEARS
When you walked away,
You said to me “GOODBYE”
Hearing this word made me cry.
Sorrowed tears fell from my eves
Because of sadness that is filling inside.
As you walked away fogs covered you.
More sorrowed tears flowed
From my eyes coz I can never see you again.
But even though you are gone,
As long as sorrowed tears flow from my eyes,
I will never forget you ‘til the day I die.
