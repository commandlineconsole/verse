I WILL FEAR NO MORE
I will fear no more of a love that I might lose or never had.
I will fear no more of a life that was not meant to be for me.
I will fear no more of a touch that I never felt.
I will fear no more for I will not permit it to get into my heart.
I will not fear that other woman that has taken my place.
I will fear no more of a broken heart for I am not easy to replace.
I will fear no more of what was or what could have been that is long gone.
My heart can not have fear for I am a child of God and he tells me to fear no more.
