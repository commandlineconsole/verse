REFLECTION OF PASSION
Gently on my way I sway-
Suddenly came a gaze,
Lost in the passion, I never say nay.
Smiles unveiling sparkling dentiton my confession-
I'm tied to linger in the phase,
That lost in the passion I hold not back my emotion.
My heart swings in pleasure I can't measure-
That I cannot... But follow the chase,
For lost in the passion: to catch a litter of her glitter.
The dance of her beauty a reality-
I'll live to solve the maze,
As lost in the passion I quit fight of the sight.
Drawn in this affection my submission;
For I dare not call it a dream, but a reality in ream-
Caught in the faze,
I'm lost in the passion of my emotion_
So I vow to bow.
