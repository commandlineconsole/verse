FEAR
Fear is the burning hell, red as the blazing flames
Fear is the hot taste of anger and revenge that you can't resist
Fear is the smell of a malicious grin of a walking devil
Fear sounds nothing more than the coldness of the dark
Fear is terror seizing you to death
Fear is the not done homework
Fear is your mother's angry face
Fear is your dad's long stick in his hands
Fear is when you get punished
Fear is everything including you
(Someone will fear you.. I guess)
