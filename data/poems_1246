WILD JASMINE
A Beauty in a stoic silence
In a mountain's lap
A Beauty in a poem's fragrances
A poet's love! a soul meditates!
Thou the scourge of a God
A moment' slip, a moment's sorrow
A  spectre of  my tear's borrow
A song of my Divine's morrow
Inside a deep silence of the wild trees
A silent sigh of an  Ocean
Thou  a scourge of  thy Heaven
In full bright into the  lap of thy Mountain
A light so  innocent
A moving delight under a Moon
A spectre in such a  jocund delight
A dream of  a  lonely heart!
