FEAR OR LOVE -
It is better to be
loved then feared
for sweet affinity
is thus endeared.
Fear is loneliness
of this I'm sure.
Fear is cowardice.
Love is the cure.
It is better to be
loved then feared
this is how reality
is so geared.
Fear is frosty
like ice in winter
it causes agony
love is better.
It is better to be
loved then feared.
What a tragdey
love can steer.
But oh what pain
fear can bring!
Better once to gain
then not have a thing.
It is better to be
loved then feared
this I see now
doubts are cleared.
Fears are trivial.
Love is divine.
Love reveals
meaning sublime.
