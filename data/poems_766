JOY
O Joy, Joy…
I am happy.
Been on a rollercoaster ride
For quite a long time
With sadness and frustration by my side.
Fought and fought to bring “Joy” back,
To show me what life is about
And tell me that it’s not so bad.
O Joy, Joy…
Brought me peace and serenity,
Made my heart fill up with hope;
And kept me glowing inside and out.
Feels great to let it all go,
To feel like I can take big strides.
To wake up in the morning
Without stress on my mind.
O Joy, Joy…
I am happy,
Woke up this morning,
Ready to sing a joyful tune;
Feeling my heart in the perfect place.
Ready to move on
And conquer my greatest fears.
