IF IT'S LOVE
If it's love then my teeth are clean for a change
If it's love then that's why I am feeling so strange
If it's love
Then I need it forever
Like the beats that keep time in my heart
If it's love
Then I fall like a feather
I'm an egg in the teeth of a shark
If it's love I'm inspired
I'm up late I'm not tired
If it's love then my world is about to spark
If it's love then my teeth are clean for a change
If it's love then that's why I'm feeling so strange
