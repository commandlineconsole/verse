OFF CAMERA
Off Camera.
Off Camera
The smile fades
Fears steel to roar
The mask set aside
Giant shadows stalk
Sadness, sadness
Off Camera
Tears fall, no reason
Hearts break
Worlds shake
Hands tightly grip
Nothing, nothing…
Off Camera
Loneliness abides
Questions arise
Unanswered
Empty feelings
Rage, rage…
Off Camera
Alone, more than a word
Or a state of mind
Replayed partings
Over, and over again
If only, if only…
Off Camera
The chest tightens
Smiles forced
Clockwork greetings
Tiresome pity sickens
Silence, silence…
Off Camera
