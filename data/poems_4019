GRANNY'S LOST HER MARBLES
I don' t care
I don't care I don't care
She screeched
As she pulled
Down her enormous
Undies and squirted
On the floor like
A filthy Tom
Before crumpling
Into the puddle
Of her own mess and
Staring up bemused
Through a gin haze
Thirty years thick
My dear old Gran
Pillar of the community
Queen of the Bridge club
