FIRE OF ANGER
Deep inside of me a fire of anger burns
This fire of anger yearns
This fire of anger is my shield
It’s become my daily need
It’s making my heart and soul bleed
This fire of anger has taken over all of me
It’s slowly becoming my desire
Keeping my mind burning like fire
It’s that voice inside me that just wants to scream
This fire of anger is haunting my every dream
It’s like a deep secret hidden, unknown, unknown one I can’t seem to find
Making all I once felt, trusted and loved slowly fade away
