UNCERTAINTY
Is uncertainty just a word or it has a meaning
Meaning which means more than what is there in the dictionary
When I saw you there was uncertainty if I could talk to you ever
When I spoke with you there was uncertainty if you could me my friend
When you became my friend there was uncertainty if you could be my very special friend
There were many more uncertainties that had come our way
Uncertainty brings surprise
Surprises are sometimes good
And sometimes they turn into shock
For me our uncertainty had been a sweet surprise
Never did I know nor did I expect to find such a wonderful friend in you
Uncertainty is life
We do not know which way it would turn
And what new challenges we may have to face
But in this uncertain world I can certainly tell you that I am your friend for life
Certainty uncertainty is not a word
