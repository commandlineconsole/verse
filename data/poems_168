! ! ! ! ! ! ! A LOVE! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
love is true to life
Love is the true complementary
True love is full of happiness
Because God behind us
impossible for us to deny its
Because love that colouring our lives
Because only love has the most beautiful dream
Love lives in every heart
O..love..love never lied to me
O..love..loveis so pure
O..love love I have it
O..love love for everyone
Because the love across the world
O..love..love always looks brighter
Because love is the lantern of the world
I'will try walking on the badland
Until i find he
Or lets me pray and hope he come to me
Because i did not want me waiting in vain
