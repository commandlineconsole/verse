I DON'T CARE
I don't care who's wrong, I don't care who's right,
I just want to stop this fight
You and I know this friendship is ending
So let's just quit all this pretending
We never ever get along
Don't tell each other when something's wrong
We always argue we never agree
If this is a "Friendship" I want to be free
I want this to be over, I know you do too,
And don't even deny it because you know it's true.
You might say it's noble to try and work it all out
But our friendship is going nowhere, without a doubt.
Even if we could change the things we feel
This "friendship" of ours would never be real.
I don't care what you do or what you say
I will always feel this way
I don't care if you hate me or if you don't
I don't care if you'll be friends or if you won't
I don't care if we're friends or if we're not
As long as this whole thing is forgot.
