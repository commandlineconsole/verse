FEARS
My life is filled with fears
Filled with tears
& it's the fears that hold me back
Will i be strong enough to get myself back on track
Love is my primal fear
It has only given me heartache
& left me with tears
When i love they don't love back
This is the fear that sends me off track
I give them truth they give me lies
It's the heartache from the lies
Which made me wanna die
Now my spirit is strong
My mind is now clear
It's with this power
I will use to alleviate my fear
