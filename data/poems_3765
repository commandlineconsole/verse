CARE
Care is very precious service
Services to be rendered by heart
Heart always advocates honesty
Honesty consist of selfless services
Selfless services are in different mode
Few care for their parents, while majority
Of them prefer to serve community as a whole
Wholesome service never demand any reward
Reward automatically-  not in monetary term- reaches
desired destination, however time may be long.
It's impact can be felt, if care is done by heart.
Care is mixture of responsibility, selfless care and
Ignoring your pain and worry and satisfaction is the reward.
