BREAKING
I am silently breaking,
Quitly shaken,
Desperately taken one breath at a time,
I know its over,
The happy I had for weeks is dead,
Its replaced with sorrow,
A sorrow the has swept the mind,
Slowly I change,
From happy,
To sad,
Im breaking,
I just try to open my eyes,
But no its to late,
Im sorrow filled,
Im full of pain,
My heart might not ever heal,
So close,
But now its too many steps back,
Im breaking,
