TELL ME YOU CARE (DOUBLE RONDELET)
And just make sure that this I know
Tell me you care
Let's cherish forever our love
I'll show you how much I love you
Nurture love and just let it grow
Tell me you care
Tell me you care
And that your love will never end
Tell me you care
I just want you so close to me
'Cause your my Honey.My best friend
Today tomorrow we'll both spend
Tell me you care
