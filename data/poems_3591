WE ARE ONE
Different times and terrains,
Different issues and concerns,
Different language, different dress
Different features, different thoughts
Of different complexion we are.
Shun your prejudice and then look,
From north to south, east to west,
Forget your repulsion and your hate
For all of us are equal... same
Only human beings we are.
