WHY CAN'T I FEEL ANGER
They say don't show anger
When they pour out all their lies
To the Judge speak slow and clearly
And look into his eyes
Don't say bad things about the mother
Even if it is all true
Concentrate on your Daughter
And protecting all her youth
These words seem true and simple
For the ones who follow rules
But I've drawn swords with the devil
Who'll use a child as her tool
Why can't I feel anger
While my child drowns in the rain
When all the court will offer
Is a childhood of pain
Why can't I feel anger
When I'm drying all her tears
Why can't I feel anger
When our futures full of fear
