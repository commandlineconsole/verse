FALLEN
The pattern’s set -
a smile, a laugh
and you have fallen, hurled like a rock,
delight, obsession,
heartache.
Never will recapture
either rapture or the highest waves
which plunge and sizzle
until one year, another laugh, delight,
the wave grows again,
gathering force
smashing rock to sand.
Three times and surely
that’s enough for one life.
