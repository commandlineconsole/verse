JOY
I have known many joys
Most have flown away
When they were at their peak
Iâ€™ve been with people having many toys
Of wealth, women or power
Their joy too lasted but awhile.
But I have seen too joy stay,
Those with and without
Abiding with it every hour.
Then I wondered what made it stick
Until I found out that their fulfillment
Was from our creator.
I prayed that He pours it in me
And yes, He did hear
I have inexpressible joy when am with Him.
