VERNAL HARBINGER
The place I walk my dog is not far from here
a patch of the forest preserve
where deer wander
casting long shadows
in morning light
But the deepest delight comes
with flickers of blue and orange
as thrushes and warblers
flit like bright shadows
to trees in bud
Then I know Spring is near at hand
my dog pauses and looks at me
as though she would ask
the cause of such delight
evident to her senses!
