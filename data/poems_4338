UNKNOWN FEAR
Unknown fear,
Is hovering my heart.
Fear of love and hatred.
Fear of victory and failure.
I can not guess it
Accurately I mean
May be one of those…
But I m too keen.
What it is about?
Why it gives me chills?
It is really dreadful,
As my soul it kills.
Might old memories
Are affecting my present,
I tried to erase
But for permanent it went,
Went deep inside…
But it bumps out,
Sometimes unexpectedly.
Withers my soul,
And rock me as whole.
At this moment,
I want a companion.
Who can comfort me,
But I found none.
Alone confronting fear,
I sometimes cry,
Hoping someone will hear.
But I find- fear, fear only fear…
