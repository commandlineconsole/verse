THE TSUNAMI FLIGHT
After celebrating the Christmas night
People slept with a great delight
But suddenly came the Tsunami Flight
And turned many's delight to their last night
Arrogant water from the heat of the sea
Flushed on to the island with a fiery speed
Rose to aheight beyond sight
And carrioed thousands of innocents with it
The Nicobari's spent their nights without shelter
For Lankans it was more dreadful rather
Instead of celebrating the 31st night
People burnt the candle of mourning light
