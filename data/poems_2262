ANGER
Anger is a simple emotion
All it is, is just feeling powerful
Or feeling to weak to be powerful
To be afraid
That is another thing of anger
Fear falls into that very category
Anger is what they say they hate most
But why?
Anger is my favorite emotion
I get to let all that i have bottled up
Surge out of my body
I can just let go
Of everything I hold inside
