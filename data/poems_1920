A COMPETITION!
Monotony in life can be vanished
If competition is brought in ever!
Then excitement and anxiety rule
The minds of all participants long!
End of competition brings relief
And surprising result engages all
Again to think about the veracity
Involved in the selection process!
Exams qualify in schools and colleges
All who have studied long there;
Likewise in life too competitions
Wake all to life to show valour.
Best among the short listed ones
Really amazes all with surprise!
