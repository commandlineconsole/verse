BROKEN FOR YOUR PLEASURE
Broken for your pleasure
A feeling I cannot measure
Has destroyed me
caused me to be
enfatuated with hurt-
and thats all I can feel
With death I flirt
It uses a reel,
to bring me closer toward it
And at times I'm all for it
So this is why I promised I wouldn't leave you?
Well this has caused me to
Break for your pleasure
Feel what I cannot measure
and its nothing but pleasure-
