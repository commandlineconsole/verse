LOOSING IN LIFE
A bridge of sadness on desires
no support to endless pride
no faith on help less glory
shadows bleeding due to fear
tear is crying like never
dreams ended with blood
shadows on a corner crying
being mad without any reason
fears sounding there dolls
celebrating their victory
on a breeze of light air
dancing before crying shadows
bridges of sadness on desires
no support to endless pride
no faith on endless glory
