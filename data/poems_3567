ACCEPTANCE
A child death weeping
Concerned remote corners patting
Mother existence watching without despair
Somewhere a girl taking her last breath
Out of hunger
Uncollected people burying her and memory
The silence of skin relish screams
A boy who could have been asleep
Held throbbing time and masturbated
Sadness of energy saverâ€™s light
The dim bulb that watches over
Lovers hurried and out of grace
Yes I have a felt-knowledge
This all is my soul
