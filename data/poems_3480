CYBERLOVE
Time, Space and a common goal
Magically blended in a poignant write
To freely express our concerns about our Earth
And spread our message of Love and Peace…
A thousand miles apart-yet,
United by our unique thoughts
Which are filtered through cyberspace,
Hoping to touch every heart in the World!
We reflect the colors of the Rainbow
Speaking the language of understanding
And sharing our love, joy, pain and hope
Within a World of uncertainties!
Our hearts bleed to death
Knowing that many young ones
Are daily wounded or killed
In those silly and unjustified wars…
Our minds are clearly disturbed
Knowing that many of our children
Are hungry and very sick
Without a future they can count on!
We are very concerned
About our own existence
In this God-given precious gift
Being destroyed by a powerful few!
The very air we breathe
Is mercilessly polluted
By those inspired by power and greed
With disregard for our survival! ..
A divine intervention is needed
To stop these evil spirits
From wiping out our lovely Earth
And give Love and Peace a chance!
