TIME TO FEAR
Picture me on the edge of sadness
I was too blind to see the truth
My hearts beating fast I'm not alone
but you're not there
Friendly smiles steal a glance
But me I'm furious inside
Can I get out of here now
Everything is falling down on me
And deep inside my mind I know I love you
Time is that all I really got to fear
From all these precious moments of my life
Time is that all I really got to fear
From all these precious moments of my life
You say I do always wrong
So you must hurt me again
I feel so sorry
but you do not
And you're not here
I question why I left you
Ain't love when under your sway
Will I be safe in here now
Eveything is falling down on me
And deep inside my mind I know I miss you
Time is that all I really got to fear
From all these precious moments of my live
Time is that all I really got to fear
From all these precious moments of my live
Time is that all I really got to fear time time
Time is that all I really got to fear
From all these precious moments of my live
Time is that all I really got to fear
From all these precious moments of my live
Time time time time
