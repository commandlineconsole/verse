TALES OF A WIFE: GROOMING HER HAIR
Enveloping her within the legs,
Mailing passion via a brush
Brushing her long…
Bushy hair
From the flaked hair-tip
Touching the crowded crown
Desire is forever
Beauty lost its hairbreadth.
Enveloping her within the legs
Mailing passion via a string
In and out
Like fork to noodle
Sequentially
Picking
Rolling
A nd packing
Enveloping her within the legs
Mailing intimacy,
Charity
To brush-over agony
Pop-up
And brush-up honey
Her mirror is oversaturated with beauty
She hates mirrors, she is homely
Parity of a brush-stroke
Passion a bubo rises
As the brush goes down
Smile always come out
Passion a limpid
Sensationally aroused
Censored!
Ah…. you young kid.
