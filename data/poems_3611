SHOULD HAVE NOT
As a male I should have not cried
All tears put out and eyes got dried
Something really worried from inside
I wanted some one close to confide
It is human mind that weeps
All sentimental tears do not keep
Within or forcefully contained
It is helplessness that has been maintained
Draughts and river floods cause anxiety
Earth quakes and bomb blasts make to feel sorry
Crush of freedom and liberty causes the anguish
Little tease troubles heart to pump the blood and finish
Medical aid is rushed to the troubled spot
People donate generously in quantity and lot
That shows how much we care for our brethren elsewhere
Show the solidarity and voice concern everywhere
To loose human life is serious loss
As it has not occurred due to natural cause
We are concerned with unnatural deaths
Where for little negligence we have to lay a wreath
Human heart stays with full of compassion
Shows love and attachment with obsession
We may be living far off from each other
Yet we wish them good luck and bother
Not all the people may be leading descent way
There may be so much pain to bear with in the way
A life is worst than animal yet we call it human
It can be understood as living hell by even layman
Let us form human chain all over the world
Where such events are noted and all over told
It is our main concern to rush for the rescue
Life has been termed as precious so deserves to be viewed
