HER
I think about her
just like I thought about her
And her
And her
This one
That one
And the rest
If I ever met her
How whould I let her know
That she was different from the others?
Is she?
What makes her special?
Each one is closer to 'The one'
As far as I'm concerned
This one is perfection
Just like the last one
And the one before that
