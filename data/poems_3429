REVISION OF TENSES
As far as actions in the past are concerned,
if you give the matter your attention,
you will recall various tenses -
the Past Continuous, the Past Definite,
the Imperfect, the Perfect, and the Pluperfect,
which we might call the more-than-Perfect;
we need not concern ourselves at the moment
with the Past Anterior.
Take, for example, this sentence
- 'I was looking for a word, and found it
in a dictionary which I had.'  You will notice
the action of looking for the word
extends over a period of time, and is Continuous.
The action of finding the word is complete
and fixed in time,
and requires the Past Definite.
While the action of possessing a dictionary,
in this sense, has no beginning and no end,
leading us to the Past Imperfect.
