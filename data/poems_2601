EERIE SADNESS
Today the sun shine bright
But a eerie brightness
I stand and look at the bluest
Sky
Clouds are white as snow
But a sadness creep within
The air
I stand trying to figure out
This sadness filling the air
With tears running down my
Cheeks
Heart is crying and wondering
What cause all this sadness
So thick
I seen a day like this once before
Maybe three times are more
I cant stop looking toward the sky
While this sadness continuously run
Inside of me
I pray not to see a death come today
Please dear God let this thing pass
Me by
Loneliness hurt alone with the grief
Oh my Lord
Let this sadness in my
Mind be clean by the new wakens of
Tomorrow dawn
I wish not to sing a funeral march nor
To hear one in my soul
This day the air is creepy and smells
Of eeriness
I feel it walking over my body today
Wearing me down like heavy chains
Chains
Just chained me down to no ends
My heart is crying can't you
See
So heavy Lord, So heavy Lord
Let tomorrow dawn lighten this
Eerie sadness as a dream
Let me wake tomorrow dawn
With happiness in my heart
And reaps of happiness at my feet
