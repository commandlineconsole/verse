MOLTEN LOVE
Lowering your thighs
...To mine
Set to take your ride
Lay me down on my bed
...rolling into the shadows
of the night
Entering into a neverworld
...without a care...we dare
There is no fright
With Passion...Carnal Lust
Tasting you, Like a thirst,
AWAKENING
The fires within you
Ride, Ride
Release The Lava
Of the passion feast,
Ride, Ride
My  thickeness deep down to  my soul,
Ride, Ride Till I die of desire,
Release the Molten Lava,
Molten
And Gold.
Peter LeBuhn
