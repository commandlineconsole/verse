FEAR THE DEVIL
Fear Fears from none
Why one fears from fear
Brave is one who fears from none
Like Brave face the fear
Fear becomes a ghost for one
When fear fears the one
Ghost fears from none
Why one scare from ghost
Brave is one who scares from none
Like Brave and face the Ghost
There is nothing that can win one
Itâ€™s one who can win everything
