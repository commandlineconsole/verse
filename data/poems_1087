MY LITTLE LIFE AND RUDI
I’m delighted by everything, the mystery
of beingness, the secrets of the universe,
the wonderful bigness still to be discovered,
the joy in happy laughter, the warmth of
hostility discarded, the cozy comfort of a
stomach filled, the softness of some fleecy
blankets, the beauty of crystal trinkets, the
magic of sleeping kittens – but most of all,
I’m delighted by the big man-boy sleeping
here with me, snoring softly, smiling in
his slumbers – the most wonderful being
in this universe, so happy in himself, he
shines the happiness onto me, and my
little life grows into an overpowering
wave of such delight – thank you
so much, Rudi...
