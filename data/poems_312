LOVE IS....
Love is love, as love is love
Love is what? Love simply is love
As the moon does glow so I do love
Ask what I do and my answer is love
Oh how silly of me to love, love, love
Of each and all I think the world of
A trap I have set for myself you say
At first thought I concur and tell all to stay away
Henceforth I begin to ponder and wonder
Why I set myself up for yet another blunder
With these expectations of love in return
I believe my heart cindered and my stomach turns
A thunderous cloud within my mind has burst
A refreshing downpour whereby I feel less cursed
I wonder and ponder and ponder and wonder
A mind enlightened by a flood of answers
These answers are clear, answers so pure
My heart, my soul I believe has found a cure
To those who do not love, I love you so
You feed me knowledge so that I can grow
To all who do not love, to all who judge
I love you! Love you and hold no grudge
You unknowingly teach me to love love love!
Oh how I do love this little mystery called love!
