THE JOY OF SUDDENLY LEARNING
THE JOY OF SUDDENLY LEARNING
The Joy of suddenly learning
One is not going to die soon-
The Joy of feeling
That one may be happy once again-
The Joy of believing in life again
For oneself and for others-
The Joy of Hope again
The Joy of Happiness again-

Happiness Again.
