TO II
Too long, my only, we have kept apart
Divided by your stiff decree-
The pillow that we shared is cold, my heart
And iffish like it never used to be;
Love, try to vanquish
Anger before anger perverts therapy:
Silence silence. Banish
Absence, so that always
Loving oaths and odes eventuate.
Anger bound up squarely,
Company can flourish.
You're the case's sitting magistrate:
Gently judge, and this harsh term refute
That you alone have power to commute.
