NOTHING TO FEAR AS YOU ARE HERE
I am self-controlled and You are powerful
Nothing to fear You are here to take my care
Though foolish and careless I am
You are my Master with me
Why should I fear, fear to whom!
I am here there everywhere
You are here there everywhere
We are both one and the same
Nobody is here except we both
Nothing to fear as You are here
And why should I fear, fear to whom!
