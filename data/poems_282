TRUE, REAL, LOVE
True love is tested
True love is best
Love is harder that all the rest
It’s balanced in wisdom
Its judgments are true
It is not just sentimental of heart
Thus, governing love with forgiveness’ glue
Love rebukes
Love brings growth
Love acknowledges what’s good for both
Love weighs “the truth” with event of time
Love, indeed, is “such a good friend” of mine
Though, love must start first from within
It frees the soul from unwanted guilt and sin
Love lives and gives, and humbly receives
It never harbours resentment for lost realities
It makes allowances for faults and frailties
Love loves to recall the best from such tragedies
Love is so contagious
It pulls on the heart-strings to win
Love will always forgive, again and again
Love gives sound boundaries, and security of space
Love give principles, so wise, for posterity’s race
Love is among equals is most often the best
Love’s quite 'a powerful word' amidst those of tranquil zest
Love is quite patient, gracious and kind
Although, love for God’s standard is- amore noble find
I hat evil, but even this takes greater courage and love to do
But the wisest of all love- is to “love Wisdom’s best” for you
