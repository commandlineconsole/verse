SORROW
Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow,
it's a cycle which never ends,
it follows you till your very last breath,
no matter how and where you hide,
you could never escape it's sight,
and it's just the matter of time,
before it devour you alive.
Where can you find refuge?
where can you find shelter?
will it really last or will it really matters?
you can run from the east to the west,
but you can never escape it's grip,
just like the air you breath,
it takes your conscious bit by bit.
By the day you realise,
you are already way too far behind,
you can never outrun it,
neither can you defeat it,
will it be possible to overcome,
the sorrow which takes you way back in time,
show me a way, show me a sign,
so i can live my life till the endless night.
