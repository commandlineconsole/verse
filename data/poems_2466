GéRARD SEKOTO, IN MEMORIUM (1913-1993)
I
Would that anger subside
pride of I against You
meum et tuum
Some words hastily released on the verge of angry pride
Tear from us a part of our flesh
Leaving us lesser men forever pitted against the
I above You
You may not - yes, now I know you didn't - have meant it
Your words were stony arrows sunk in the mud of my hurt
splitting even before they found the unintended target
There may yet have lingered then a little bit of the malin in you
That ultimate grace-saver in your embattled loneliness
I didn't realise your hurt was legendary
each in our indelible separateness
Your age   your despair    your self-abandonment
in the gorge of medicines
in the crises that felled you
careering through terrifying electric storms
leaving you year after year worsted
wiping duster-strokes of your memory clean
I didn't stop to think

Your demise is the passing of an age
is the passing of a people's pain
In your veins you take with you a hundred years
of hurts and slings
though
driven into your lonesome corner
upright against the inroads of a Rhodes
or the pitted power of Buthelesis
finding in the milling Seine
in the plucky rhythms of an ebony-and-ivory keyboard
in the hidden skeins of your eyes
beating with the heart of downtrodden generations
that ultimate refusal of defeat
Long are the years you have lain your easel down
Longer still the sun at Botshebelo burnishing your skin
In the soft autumnal retreat of your heart
You could still hear children playing in the mission station
You saw with what glee they jigged in Sophiatown
And bled for your brothers enchained in District Six
Away in the quiet slumber of a land you loved
You wrought the blazing colours of a secret rage
in the embrace of a Mandela
Not a shaft of light escaped your hunt for
traces of your childhood
were lost the spare airs that filtered through shanty-towns
Your world was a world of people
going about their chores with premeditated caution
endowed by need with the guile for survival
People for whom you lived
People who live on in your veins
(Poem read by the author at Sekoto's funeral in Neuilly-sur-Marne, France)
