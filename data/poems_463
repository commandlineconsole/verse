COME MY MAN
Come my Man,
come into me
gently, harsh, push, hold my hips
tight
and push, push, deep, deeper, more
make me shout
scream, moaning,
cry
for passion waves which goes over me
again and again
hold me tight,
make me scream and cry
for passion, desire.
Let me feel your weight onto me,
give me feelin safety
under you i find my passion,
with no limits to restrictive this feeling of mine
so my Man hold me tight,
make me scream and shout
express this delight.
