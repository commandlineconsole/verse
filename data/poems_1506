THE CYCLE
i say
pain is pleasure
and pleasure is the pain
because no matter what
the lust remains the same
combined with empty words
connected to people with no names
in this shiesty society
of mind games
that targets the heart
and break us for our unforgiving mistakes
day by day
we take the hate
that others make
and create this wall
that soon will crumble down
to start a cycle of
pleasure and pain and lust
Trust,
it's a must for us to survive
before we all die
and inside i cry
because I try to stay alive
