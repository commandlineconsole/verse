A LITTLE SADNESS
Reflecting from the darkness of a time that seems like a week,
a teardrop runs down and caresses my cheek,
I try to smile but my little bit of sadness has dragged me down,
down to the place underneath the ground.
When the pain strikes across like a light,
I now know I shouldn't put up a fight.
Its just that little bit of sadness coming around again,
Its just that little bit of sadness coming around the bend.
Hell is coming closer,
closer to my door,
shall I reply,
or does it want more.
The sunlight fights its way away from me,
it tries to drown me with the hands of the sea,
I try to smile but my little bit of sadness has dragged me down,
down to the place underneath the ground.
I lose my soul in between the big world war,
It hurts me right down to my heart-broken core,
Its just that little bit of sadness coming around again,
Its just that little bit of sadness coming around the bend.
So distant, so far,
I still look up at the same little bronze star,
one day you shall finally see,
the pain you have caused to me.
Just as it is, unmisted by love and dislike,
Or the simple unsympathetic strike,
I try to smile but my little bit of sadness has dragged me down,
down to the place underneath the ground.
I don’t want to see your unwanted reaction
you see, its an unnecessary subtraction
Its just that little bit of sadness coming around again,
Its just that little bit of sadness coming around the bend.
To and fro a gentle breeze takes me down,
and what lies upon me now is just a broken crown,
no more glory no more fame,
I dont want to play this dreaded game.
I can't take my time to worship you anymore,
I feel washed up among the sandy shore,
I try to smile but my little bit of sadness has dragged me down,
down to the place underneath the ground.
I see the light but I don’t feel the heat,
I remember the times but it just feels so obsolete,
Its just that little bit of sadness coming around again,
Its just that little bit of sadness coming around the bend.
I look up at the sky and see the opening,
sometimes its all about the focusing,
Its just that little bit of hope that makes its way,
Its just that little bit of hope that captures its prey.
