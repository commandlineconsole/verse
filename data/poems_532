I SAVE MY PASSIONS
I don't dislike you with a passion.
I just dislike you.
I save my passions,
For more worthy events that benefit.
Some people talk,
From both sides of their mouths.
In the belief they are providing comic relief.
I see this as a distasteful embellishment.
At someone's expense...
Who is believed not to know the cost of it.
I don't dislike you with a passion.
I just dislike you.
I save my passions,
For more worthy events that benefit.
