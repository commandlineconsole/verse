REJOICE
R is for Rejoice, always rejoice coz Christ has filled you with joy
E is for Eternal, the Joy of the Lord in you is sempiternal and eternal
J is for Jesus, who authored and offered you the joy, but don’t just enjoy
Offer the joy to all the people around you: be liberal
I is for ignition, invite and ignite others to enjoy and employ
Christ’s joy in their lives. Speak it, make joy your voice
Even when you don’t feel like it Rejoice, always Rejoice!
