SADNESS,  I SERENADE
Sadness, I Serenade
To Exhibit what is in you Heart
An Act of Courage or a Fool
To Express the Dreams within your Soul
Transforms not the Ore into a Jewel
It was her Spirit which touched me
Escorted by Beauty and Grace
Providing Wings to my Passion
Passion to my Embrace
I prayed to the Heavens, prayed to the Depths
Prayed for compassion, to stop my reminisce
The aromas, sounds, images
The touch of her hand, the taste of her kiss
I pleaded with Angels of Heaven, and Demons in Hell
Pleaded for mercy, from my mind please erase
All aromas, sounds, images
Her beckoning eyes, her radiant face
I received no reply
All ignored my requests
So, now, here in my darkness
The Sadness persists
The sadness of longing
The longing of desire
Accompanied by emptiness
That light-consuming fire
Sleep comes only with illusions of her breath
The memory is rhythmic, soothing, and kind
Morning speaks with dreams of her whispers
Till I open my eyes, and the truth hits my mind
Sitting in darkness
With very few hopes, far too may fears
Closing my eyes, I examine my heart
All that I find is silence and tears
Sitting in darkness
With very few hopes, far too many fears
Until at last I submit
To the sadness and tears
