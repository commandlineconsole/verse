DOORS OF TOMORROW
Drive in through the doors of tomorrow
Forget all your pains and sorrows
And look forward for a morn
that has a bright dusk and dawn
And remember that all that is bad
Will surely change into glad
And then everywhere will come spring
And rosy will be everything
Just have faith in the tomorrow
And forget all your pains and sorrows
And hope to see always the best
And learn to bravely face life's test
And know that is is really true
That a courageous smile can take away blue
And it can surely change all bad
Into things that are really glad
And this can surely be done tomorrow
If you'll learn to forget your sorrow.
