YOU LET HIM CONTROLL YOU.
Drink
It's all you do
Fight
It's all you have to do
Put all your anger on other people
The anger from him
You take out on me
Thats just not healthy
For you or me
We should be set free
Not locked in somebodys cage
Don't let him controll you
Stand up for your self
Don't let others tell you
What to do
Or what you want
It's just fucking stupid
Just like you
So let your self be free
Don't let others
Brain wash you
And tell you what to do
Stop being stupid
And set yourself free
