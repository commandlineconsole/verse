YOU SURPRISED ME
You surprised me
Yes, you surprised me
With your elegance
With your beauty
With your grace.
Your speech
And the manner you carried yourself
So effortlessly - surprised me.
Your beautiful hair
Reaching upto the knees
Begging for attention
And appreciation - surprised me.
Your being there, surprised me.
It was like I had at last found her
And this fact - surprised me.
The fact that the effect of that first meeting
Had me writing this, surprised me.
The inspiration your beauty gave me - surprised me.
And I wouldn't be surprised, if I surprised myself,
By surprising you into being my friend.
No, I wouldn't be surprised
If I make myself,
Come to you through some pretext
To just have the pleasure of your company.
And, I wouldn't be surprised
If I start believing in the
'Love-at-first-sight' concept
Yes, surprises haven't ceased to exist.
