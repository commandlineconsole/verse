MR. JOHN GLENN
There once was an apple
That had fallen from a tree
I picked it up, and it was stuck
To my hand, I could'nt get free
So I shook and shook and shook
Until my hand was sore
But from deep inside, I heard a cry
Way inside the core
I ask myself what could it be
A snake or even a worm
Can it breathe or even sneeze
Should I be concerned
But then I heard a voice within
And now I'm really baffled
I'll ask my teacher if there's a creature
Inside this nice red apple
And if she says no, there's no such thing
Why are you  asking me this
Cause if I don't ask, this too shall not pass
And i'll be taking a risk
The teacher says, now don't be silly
There's nothing inside this fruit
Now don't be a clown, just go put it down
And join the rest of the group
Then she stood up and held up the apple
And said, class this is my friend
I was a little concerned about bringing a worm
Whom I call, Mr. John Glenn
But teacher you said to never ever lie
Not even a little or a lot
Well if he gets loose, you'll see it's the truth
A creature John Glenn is not
