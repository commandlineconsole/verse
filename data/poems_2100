SURPRISE
Surprise
surprise
I cannot hide
that I am free without you.
The world has opened up
once more
- the way I used to doubt you
is nothing but a memory
or lines within my journal.
My love for you was a disease
born from some deep maternal
need I had to comfort you
and stop all of your aching
it just resulted in despair
and led but to the breaking
of my poor heard which has reworked
its tissues once again
And if a boy
knocks on my door
(and claims to be a friend
I will remember my
poor heart)
and will not let
him in.
