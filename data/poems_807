WREATHE YOUR ARMS
That red-bowed Christmas wreath, signal of cheer,
announces irrepressible gladness
with happy rotundity of green joy!
Projecting circular intimations,
it circulates an aura of good will.
We hope that joy will not come to an end,
an inspirational thought-remedy
for despondency and general gloom
amid cloud-filled, abbreviated days
when we need to be reminded of when
the circle gleams with sunnier aspect.
Memorialize the green, give warm wreath hugs,
let not the circle of joy be brokenâ€”
give everyone you meet the gift of joy!
