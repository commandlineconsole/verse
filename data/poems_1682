#   OH  GOD
oh god
give me the leisure
or the pleasure
to lead this life
like the sun or the moon
they appear
as fresh as a babe
as if newly born....
every other day
they tread their paths
without a complain
ever learning....
they do not seem to be aging
oh god....
leisure and pleasure
like them...let it be mine
amidst a world
compassing duty in hand
