COURAGE
To live with courage is to live with fear.
No man can attain true courage without overcoming true fear.
For unless one knows how paralyzingly fear can be, one cannot know the courage it takes to conquer such fear.
Walking a path in life in which one is not afraid does nothing to strengthen the soul. It is only when you are scared to death that courage produces confidence, faith and trust. Every man should know fear without shame. Never consider fear a sign of cowardice. Only lack of action in the face of fear is cowardice.  Courage is facing fear daily and becoming its master. - Tom Krause
