RAINDROPS & TEARS
Sadness reigns
With every dropp of rain
As my tears fall down
In this feeling I am drowned
Raindrops fall endless from the sky
With each little droplet falls so many “whys”
In this endless pool of questions
I long for liberation
Tears flow down slowly from my eye
Streaming the sadness from the darkness of the sky
In this invisible cage of loneliness and despair
I am trapped in the bosom of the freezing stormy air
Raindrops and tears both go together
It seems like I feel the sadness of the skies
And as the clouds start to gather
My soul slowly dies
Sadness reigns
When raindrops speak of pain
As my tears flow down
I wear my lonely crown…
