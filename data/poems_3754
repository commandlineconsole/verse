FOSTER CARE
No love
No care
Parents that just in it for the money
Medicating us
Moving us
Like pawns on a chess board
One place to another
First group homes
Then abusive homes
Why are we being punished
It’s not our fault
Foster Care
Were not loved
Were treated like we’re not important
Were the foster care youth
Listen to us
We need love not medicine
We need hope
Please give us the chance we deserver
We are the foster care youth of the world
HEAR US
Foster Care
