SENSUAL LOVE â€“ SONNET
Oh love song of my heart come in here still
And fill your richness in all its time's glow
My dreams are there to come around to fill
And every morning is new on its go
Ocean is as wide apart as love is vast
And bringing feeling on to its rising shore
With lofty towers buried in to its cast
And always pleasures for some more and more
I've seen increase in every state going
With all this passion that comes to give
And on to time my heart's therefore flowing
To bring new experience and more to live
Oh love adore that we cannot be without
You fly my wings with pleasures first - then doubt
