LOVE BE GONE
love is deep inside
love always swings by
love knocks on your door
three times a day
love is in the air
love theres plenty to share
love is a way of life
love can't be cut with a knife
love kills and destroys
love can close and open many doors
love comes when your hurt
love comes when your mad
love comes in many ways
love comes but can be sent away
some say they don't want to be in love
but love is still there
love doesn't go away
theres going to always be
some one to love you
or some one you love
some wish there was a
love be gone.
love be gone is a mile
away waiting
for the right one to frown and say
i  hate you, i don't love you
love be gone is here to stay
love be gone always wants to play
