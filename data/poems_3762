I DON'T CARE
Funny, I don't care
Don't empathize
Don't pity
Don't dramatize
Don't sigh for me
You see, I do not care
You merely prod the numb
With your thoughts and your stares
And your empty comfort words
Provide unneeded repair
Surprised? I don't care
Don't harbor fake concern
Please save us all the time
Still your shamming lips
Don't rehearse your sorrow chime
With very few, do I really care
If you feel you must be “thoughtful”
If you feel you must be “fair”
Simply follow my example
Set for you, and please don't care
