CARE
When did you even care?
When you stayed silent?
Or when you talked about your miserable life?
When did you really care?
When you forgot to call?
Or when all you thought about is how I should support you?
When did you show me you cared?
When you’ve taken on new lovers and friends?
When you forgot to spell my name correctly in the mists?
Then why should I care
If you don’t...?
When you do care for me…
Then I’ll remember to care for you
I am not your toy for you to trash…
I am not your emotional ploy for you to have
I do not give a damn about you, ‘love’
So you can go to the ‘pits’ and die!
