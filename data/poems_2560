SADNESS
Sadness runs through
Every time I look at you
Nothing but hate and despair
Like a soul alone in the air
Sadness runs through
Every time I think of you
Though all I see is misery
Every time u remind me of me
Sadness runs through
Every time I touch you
I feel the hatred that runs in you
Though its weird it runs in me too
Sadness runs through
Every time I hear you
Hear your shrieks of pain
As they shatter in my brain
Sadness will always run though
No matter what I do
I will always think of you
And finally thank you for this wonderful life
All youâ€™ve given me is a heart pierced with a knife
