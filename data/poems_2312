BE NOT ANGRY
He who angers you conquers you
Be not angry since you cant change that person
as you want them to be
since you cant change yourself
as you want to be.
anger is nothing more
but a sign of fear.
thou should reject false pride
and tame the anger.
Dont be angry since you have fallen deep,
deep into a black hole of evil
there are endless possibilities.
believe what you think is right
in your heart you are what you are
