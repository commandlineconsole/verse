EARLY MORNING LIGHT
November, all is grey
but the sweat on our lips, fire on our tongues,
the moist, subtle dew on the dawn
This love, not understated by the moon,
not by lyrics in a song,
the stars shine, first night
like Everest's kiss.
Bend me now
take my air
against you, breathe
know my passion
Fireflies in the light of a smoky haze
dance on the rims of our fingertips
morning circles drunkenly
I had you for an hour,
eternity can wait,
beauty is momentary,
passion is stationary,
curiosity can only sedate me for awhile,
I am the one your looking for.
Look for me
