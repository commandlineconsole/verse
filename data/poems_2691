I LIVE IN YOU
When you feel alone.
When the sadness floods you,
look for me!
Only knock on the door of your heart
and there, you will find me.
When you feel alone
and sadness comes down
by your cheeks, transformed into tears.
Come!
Call me!
Only knock on the door of your soul
and I will come to dry your tears.
When you feel alone
in the inmesity of the solitude of your sadness.
Invoke me!
You know that I will always be in you.
You know that you always can count on me,
to teach the roads of life
With tears of happiness and absence of sadness...
