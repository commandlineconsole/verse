ALONE
Do you hear me?
Do you see me?
Do you care?
When I open up to you,
you shut me out, ignoring the signs
of lonliness.
When I up-do my physical apperance
you tear me down, ignoring the signs
of lonliness.
Do you care
that I am alone?
Do you care..
Do you care
that I need you, to care for, to love, to be loved.
Do you care
that I am alone?
