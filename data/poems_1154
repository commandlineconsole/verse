EUTERPE
Euterpe thy name is gladness
thou art one of the nine muses
daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne
beautiful goddesses it is thee
who govern the various arts
that stir ornament human life
quicken perceptions
deepen understanding
in quest mind mankind
goddesses associated
with god Apollo
music and healing
Euterpe thou speaks
to poets in lyric poetry
juggling flute music
are your favoured passions
goddess employed spinning
lines poetic in mine spun mind
rejoicing well of delight
in music giver of delight
river dance of sparkling light
See also the poem ‘Midnight Call’.
