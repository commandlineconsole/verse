OH YE WOMEN
Lust, the antidote of sexual pleasure.The pleasure that seeks to destroy the heart of great men.Great men with high and intellect brains, Have backsliding in the confines of life.Life that sour the happy man's life.Why can' t we resist the sexual pleasures of today.And embrace perfect rosy in future.The ladies are nothing but agents of destruction sent to ruin the life of the ruler(man) .Fortunately, their cardinal aims have boomeranged.Like lions tamed in the heart of the savanna grass.Oh! poor you, women of destruction.Your aims have boomeranged, I mean backfired!
