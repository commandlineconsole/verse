A POEM FOR SINGERS WHO END THEIR SONG TOO SOON
Those who are sad and listen to the night's song
And wait for the sadness to end
Know the sadness can never end
Even if the song ends many times
Night after night there are so many songs
And there is so much sadness
But the sadness never ends
Though the songs end
Sadness is greater than any song
Greater than any night
It goes on and on within us
Whatever the time and whatever the music
Life is a song of sadness
And when life ends
Perhaps then the sadness ends
But before then
Sadness is the song
Night and day and always
Sadness is the song we sing without end
