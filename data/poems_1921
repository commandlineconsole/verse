SHATTER TONIGHT
Shatter and matter, frown if you like,
Frighten the neighbourly people to overstate;
Physically the meanings of odes are sincere,
On this end of the dance we surprise the ends.
Mathematics dissolves the crises creeping on us,
Our overspreading tax surprises the world.
A ptarmigan can be eaten tonight
When hunted for the whole statement.
