A STORM, A BRAINSTORM
look at the window
something lingers on there
this sadness
so clear to me now
the snowy land, the roofs of houses
covered by this certain coldness
this sadness
in my mind
look at the window
a snowstorm is coming
and i wil be here in the hiding
on some confusion
i will stay
and look out the window still
and impulse comes
a solution
this darkness
this death of beliefs
this death of beliefs in the humanity of other people
this
this death, this idea of death
it is not a lovely day for me
