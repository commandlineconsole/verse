ANGER WITHIN
Forgive me for thinking that you could ever do any wrong
My heart knows that I shouldn't quick to anger
But the yen to my yang is furious inside
Within me burns a rage of hurt hate and anger and despair
Anger hath forced me to write
The words on this paper hath spared you once again
Till we meet again
My friend
Till we meet again
