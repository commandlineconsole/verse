THE SHADOW
Nobody follows you in your sadness
But everybody follows you in your happiness
But there is a person who follows
You in your happiness and sadness
It’s none other than the shadow
Shadow makes you know what you do
Shadow follows you wherever you go
Shadow is your closest friend who has no luxuries
Shadow makes you bigger when you become smaller
You can tell lies to anybody
But not to a shadow who is every time back of yours
But we must never reject it
Because it’s your friend who follows you until your death
