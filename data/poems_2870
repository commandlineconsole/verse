IT STOPS HERE
Take your self in a photograph
and share it with your friends,
and hold a sign to mark the line
where all of your sadness ends,
Because sadness will run a marathon
if possible, over your life
and you will be left unprepared
unless you nip it in the bud
tonight.
Every life has enjoyed some grief,
it helps to illuminate the good,
because it always can become much more,
believe me
because I know that I could.
So appreciate what youâ€™ve been given,
granted and designated to hold,
whether it is treasure or love
or both,
a love worth more than gold.
