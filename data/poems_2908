SORROW
Sorrow has purchased me-
How easily-cheaply!
Has sorrow purchased me?
Never thought in this manner,
Never thought in this manner-
Green thicket will be burnt.
Green thicket will be burnt
Shiuly and bakul flower
will be odd looking
The Padma- the Megna River
will be desert.
Sorrow alas! Sorrow
How easily your eyes sweep away,
burns causing pain.
Sorrow causes to weep
sorrow sweeps away
Sorrow burrs mind.
Broken heart your physique
Broken heart stamina;
Mind can’t tie with sorrow
Can’t plodding on with sorrow
Sorrow either to me or to you
Give no happiness.
Alas! Sorrow either to me
Or to you
Give no happiness.
