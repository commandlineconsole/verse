OF THE KINDES AND FRUTES OF GOOD AND YLL
Knowen good devyded into three,
Profytt, delighte, and honestye;
And yll alsoe hathe three of name,
Whiche all menn call, losse, payne, and shame,
Whosoe the good by payne achyves,
The payne passethe, the good revyves:
Whosoe the yll by pleasure attaynes,
The pleasure fades, the shame remaynes:
Thus payne for good bringethe longe fame,
Pleasure for yll bringethe longe shame.
