A BIT OF BOTH
Life is filled with surprises
some are large, some are small,
and there are some surprises
that are never welcome at all.
We walk through life accepting
the good with the bad,
but always hoping for the best
and always dreading the worst.
No matter which way we look at it,
life is going to give us a bit of both.
