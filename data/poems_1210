THE NIGHTS DELIGHT
She quivered in shallow bursts of pleasure
Rising up like a fantastic sunrise
Her body displaying a fit of delight
As her toes curled and her breath gasped
She climbed up into this state of bliss
Her lover delighted to journey with her
The place inside herself opened up
Like a deluge from within now
Flowing out her every part of self
They now are together as one
In this night the world smiles upon them
And they upon the world
