LIMITLESS SORROWS
The moment I peep,
In the tank of thoughts.
The memories I found,
Of the daunting stock.
All were not sweet,
In the tank of thoughts.
Blushing and fading all the stock,
Was filled with my limitless sorrows….
Sorrows indeed are the friends alone;
Longing and lasting and waking with own.
Sorrows are what I got today
When the most loving marred my say…
Walking continues, unending indeed;
And all what I have are sorrows to breathe….
