DARKNESS IS A VIRTUE
There are things in life better left untold
in the side of the house
where the old lady stands
there is a lavish of darkness
coming your way
Love is forsaken
but stories are true
the old lady sings
with streeks of sadness
she thinks that there is nothing
for thou she is true
if only there was some body
just like you
For she lives in the house
where she stands to hurt you
if only you live
were sadness is a virtue
