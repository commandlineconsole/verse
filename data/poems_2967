THE MORNING LIGHT IS OUTSIDE/ THE MORNING SORROW WITHIN
The morning light is outside
The morning sorrow within
Which will overcome today
I don't know
I try to be in the light
But the sorrow at times is overwhelming
How can I make the sorrow the light?
I can't
The sorrow itself must
And sometimes it does
Often it does
Later in the day.
