MATTER IS DEAD
dead or dying.
And in it, craving
craves its dissolution,
rehearses dissolution.
Expense of energy
in voluntary death.
Do not keep it young
or leave a creaky scream unwrung,
a forbidden song unsung,
a sin unsunned.
A pleasure's but a pleasure,
and on pleasure's wings
a man gets high,
remembers that sirens sing
and dolphins sigh,
that matter
never matters.
