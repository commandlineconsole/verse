UNDER BEAUTIFUL WATER
.....is a place
where leaks in your thinking
merge into clear coolness
and deep cries
know no boundries,
only rise as bubbles
that shatter and meet with air
this place
is where taking a breath
will take you beyond
the two realities
but the choice
is in the moment
it's a place where
weighty concerns flow
and no straight line exists
only wavy motions
that move beyond
shallow concerns
in the appearance of life
under beautiful water
is where two realities merge
without pause
beyond
the bubbles that meet
with air.
