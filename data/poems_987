IMPRINTS OF YOU
To have known you even for an instant
To have seen you from afar
To have been graced by your presence
Your smile and your beauty
The sound of your voice reverberating
Soothing and refreshing
To have experienced your absence
And the ensuing darkness
And to have enjoyed the pleasure
Of your presence once again
My mornings suddenly rejuvenated
And you the joy and rejoicing of my life
There at my place of humbling
I depart now with joy having absorbed
The best and beautiful in you
I depart with imprints of you on my soul
Vestiges of your presence around me
And still the joy and rejoicing of my heart
As I look back to that place of humbling
