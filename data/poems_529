PASSION LOST OR FOUND
The passion for life I had surrendered
The passion for love I could not remember
I felt like passion was now and fore ever forbidden
I kept myself entangled and hidden
From the world I felt was so unforgiving
Till a stranger walked in at the beginning of December
As I looked at him I said to my self no that's forbidden
Then i asked my self do i dare or shall i surrender
Then my passion for love had been unbroken
Then i knew I was in control of the world that was so unforgiving
With tears in my eyes and my stranger at my side
My hopes and dreams drowned all my sorrows in to the night
Then all of a sudden my hopes and dreams came back to me never again to be forbidden or taken back......
