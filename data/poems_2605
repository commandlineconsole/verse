SADNESS
Let me try to convey the pain of sadness:
What do you feel when you are sad?
The feeling that no one can go through,
But the emotion that one can persists.
Sadness can control your temper,
But don't let it drive you completely.
Sadness can make life more interesting.
Sadness helps us appreciate happiness,
Because happiness is a freedom from suffering.
Imagine saying goodbye to your love one
And never say 'hellow' to him/her again.
What do you do when that pain strikes?
Do you wail or do you neglect it?
You experience the emotion when the one you love don't love you in return.
Love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel
That's sadness, that's how the pain strikes.
The emotion of sadness.
