WHAT SHOULD I TELL THESE PEOPLE?
It was my dream that i can get little luck here in this world.
In this whole world may i get little love from someone?
I could’nt get anything till i was alive, do me a favour by attending to my funeral atleast,
Concerned people are asking me now, but what should i tell them,
Dark-Spots i have had in my heart how do i explain them,
Concerned people are asking me again n again now, but what should i tell them,
There are many dark-spots in my heart and there are many on this head...
People who could hold my hand, its true how can they hold now too hence refused me...
Dark-Spots i have had in my heart how do i explain them,
Now what should i tell them if they also ask me the same thing,
Concerned people are asking me again n again now, but what should i tell them,
Once i had a village of known, now it has become township of unknowns,
Is there anyone in this town can listen to my hearts voice,
Why are you people throughing stones on me now,
it’s been a while my heart is broken and it can’t be broken anymore...
Leave it now its no point me counting how many peaces my heart is broken into,
There was a time when i was once heart beat of several peope in this village,
Now in this town of unknowns it seems no one wants to hold me again,
People are asking me the reason why am i not like before, what should i tell them?
What should i tell all these people how i got these dark spots i have on my heart.
