MY SEARCH
What is it that i am lookin for here and there
I have everything for what my heart cares
Then why am i feeling so restless inside
That deep sinking feeling haunts me besides
Am i feeling that life is passing me by
I have so much to do learn and try
I was told i am here for a purpose well set
I am searching so hard i 've fumed and fret
What is that passion everyone talks about
Heavens help me  aloud if you care i shout
Is it something that in this birth i wont discover
A mystery a dilemma unheard uncovered
In a haze i see myself walking with  pride
Waving at hordes who look at me as a guide
Then i wake up my Dream all shattered
My Soul my heart in pieces all scatterd
For i am living each day as it comes
With no purpose no passion to talk of under the sun
Master of the universe  i beg and plead
Show me the road to my passion that leads
Before my Soul gives up and gives away
I want to know my purpose my passion i pray
i want to know my purpose my passion i pray
