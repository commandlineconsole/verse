THE MORNING SUN
The Morning Sun
The morning sun shines brightly down on your life
Taking away all your strife
Peace, contentment and joy I do see
So you can be all you can be
Take some time just for yourself
That will help expand your wealth
Wealth in family and friends who love you for you
So you can do all you can do
Contact your family and friends and stay in touch
For everyone concerned this is not too much
We are all concerned about how you are
For some of us the distance is too far
