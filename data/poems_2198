ANGER IS ME
So much anger inside of me
Im so close to exploding
Dont get close to me
Anger Is Me
I am on the edge of breaking
There wont be any warning
My body will shake and my eyes will tear up
Anger Is Me
There isnt much time before I blow up
Anger Anger
It is taking over me
Anger Is Me
It is the passion that will destroy me
I wish it would let me be
As everyone can see anger is me
