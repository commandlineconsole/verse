IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE
For me the easiest thing to describe is sadness
Sadness, has no end to it.
Life, isn't a fun ride
Is the reality of life.
Life is difficult and impossible to escape
Sometimes I wish that I could just end this life of mine
And the story would end, as this is how I describe my life to be
As sadness is the only thing which is in my life.
