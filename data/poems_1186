A SMILE OF DELIGHT
To brighten up the world
Turn on your light
The light of care
And the smile of delight
So the world can be
A place of cheer
Where kindness is found
In all life's layer
For world now needs
Someone who is kind
Who loves it all
And do it with mind
And brighten up the world
By turning his light
The light of care
And a smile of delight.
