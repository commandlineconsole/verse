SADNESS UNSPOKEN
Never underestimate sadness
it can creep up on you like a tempest
even in the midst of gladness
and will put your heart and mind to test
sadness has its own way
and you know not where it will go
no dam, to your dismay,
can stop it's flow
Sadness must run its course
It may leave only to ruturn
knocking you down with it's force
and searing you with it's burn
the smallest memory can be a trigger
and make an old wound open
and the hurt bigger
dispite your wishin' and hopin'
Leaving your heart breaking
and your spirit broken
All of you aching
Sadness unspoken
