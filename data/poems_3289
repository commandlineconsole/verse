IS IT WRONG?
Is it wrong for me to worry and be concerned, or to think these things
I'm worried and concerned that maybe no-one hugs you unexpectedly from time to time
I'm worried and concerned that maybe you are not held closely
I'm worried and concerned that you dont experience wonderful close intimate moments
I'm worried and concerned that maybe no-one kisses you regularly
I'm worried and concerned that maybe no-one tries to make you feel special
I'm worried and concerned that maybe no-one whispers words of love to you
I'm worried and concerned that maybe no-one does special things for you
I'm worried and concerned that maybe you dont feel appreciated and wanted
I'm worried and concerned that maybe you dont really feel loved at times
Is it wrong for me to worry and be concerned? Is it wrong to worry about someone or be concerned about someone if you have strong feelings for that person? I am being selfish or a fool for believing that I am the only one who feels this way about that person? Why do I worry then? I worry because I care, I worry because I'm concerned, I worry because I dont want to see that person hurt, I worry because I dont want that person to feel lonely or empty and I think these things because of my strong feelings for this person. They say this is what love causes?
If I were in a position, or if I had the right, or if I had the chance
I would love to hug that person from time to time
I would really want to just hold that person close to me
I would want to experience close, mindblowing intimate moments with that person
I would want to kiss that person at least once a day
I would make that person feel the most special person on this earth
I would always whisper kind words of love to that person during our intimate moments
I would enjoy doing things for that person, to make that person feel special
I would do things and tell that person things to make that person feel so appreciated and wanted I would make that person feel that they are loved
Is it wrong for me to say what I have said, or think what I have thought? Do I have this right?
