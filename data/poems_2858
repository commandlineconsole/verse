LEFT ALONE
I'm alone once again
No one to talk to, but myself
Crawl into bed and cry
That seems to be the only thing i know
Hugging my pillow tight
Crying, wishing the loneliness will go away
Wishing someone would come and save me from myself
From the sadness and the fears
Left alone
No one to go home to
The sadness and tears have found their way back in
Oh what a shame
I was just happy a minute ago
But things change so fast
One thought and I'm crying again
I was left alone again
I don't feel safe
When you leave me with myself
I'm sad when...
I'm left alone
