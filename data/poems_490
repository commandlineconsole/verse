CREATING GIVING
life weighted life heavy
life path impossibilities
too heavy to burden carry
when life feels heavy
passion is regeneration fuel
which keeps us running ready
it is strange
but when life
is flavour lived
with passion
ardent belief
grey heavy
times pass
passion fuels
seeds dreams
creating
giving
makes
life
worth
living
