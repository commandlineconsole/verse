MISSING
In my absence
Things haven't changed
More friends were made
More hearts were broken
Her trust did fade
A concern has awoken
How could she forget
Those days we spent
It was a long tme ago
But, am I so unimportant
She never cried for me, I know
I actually thought she would
Dreaming reminds me of her
I would kiss her, if I could
To her the past is one big blurr
Thinking makes her breathe deep
I left a message in her sleep
I guess she wouldn't listen
She never thought to herself
Isn't someone missing.
