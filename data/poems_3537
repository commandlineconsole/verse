MEDICAL MAYHEM OR MADNESS 1JULY 2009
Doctors in Government Hospitals are striking
shouts a terrible State, “Neglecting your
patients, you callous murderers! ”
“If you don’t return to work for no pay you will
be sacked! ” How amusing – and yet the same
Government argues concern for human life
Young doctors must pay back student loans –
to work for no pay is Government strategy
reinforced by threatening to sack them
Should doctors persist in demanding improved
hospitals, hours of work and salaries then
the patients will be left without them
Government doesn’t give a damn for ill and
needy, simply requires a charade of non-existent
Government Health Care be played by doctors
Fresh from university, working long internship
hours for no pay, patients not considered in this
power play, these are pawns who must obey
Whether patients live or die is not the State’s
concern as long as Health Care in dirty, under-
staffed, run-down Government institutions is
achieved by doctors on no salary…
