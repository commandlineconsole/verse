POETIC VOICE
Please forgive me if
My voice is adrift
Can’t get to the point
With pains is my joint
Love daily to paint
With spring bright colors
Logical canvas ain’t
My strongest numbers
In poetry I’m told
Perfection does need both
Logic and passion's hold
To mold the perfect growth
I do excel in only one
Passion- But not the other-
I wish I could achieve a home run
For country and my mother
But a devoted mother loves
All children unconditionally
I’ll wear her piety white gloves
Her passion fuels my biology
