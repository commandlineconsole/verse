STRUMMING SOULS
heart is pounding in your chest
mind is racing right and left
eyes blind, a screen of red
body urging fight or flight
speakers start to scream out
songs of anger and of pain
your
heart slows down
mind goes blank
eyes clear and close
you don't think
and
anger rushes out of you
with every note
the guitar plays
with every lyric
that matches your deep pain
with every beat of the drums
that mirror your urge to strike out
Music is your saving grace
Music lets you scream and shout
Music helps you to cry out
it lets your tears not be in vain
it hears your anger and your pain
it saves your life
so you can live another day
