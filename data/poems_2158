DARK-AWAKE
There are ways to be awake
For the empty times ahead
Every road will go and take
Where each footstep will lead
I've tried to leave behind
What is now all out of sight
But can not seem to find
What is here wrong or right
Twinkling stars in dark sky
Are the only guiding beams
For each coming and goodbye
And what here in shadow seems
I can't believe blindly in fate
For there is something more
With each mindâ€™s touching state
You can never be too sure
Walk around to get through
Falling love is lost in eyes
You must always become true
Leave behind deception lies
Take your wounds make them heal
Fill your dreams with its surprise
You are only what you feel
Heart of fire and sometimes ice
Twinkling stars in dark sky
Are the only guiding beams
For each coming and goodbye
And what here in shadow seems
Walk around to get through
Falling love is lost in eyes
You must always become true
Leave behind deception lies
Take your wounds make them heal
Fill your dreams with its surprise
You are only what you feel
Heart of fire and sometimes ice
