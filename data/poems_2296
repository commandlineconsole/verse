ANGER (THIS IS NOT DIRECTED AT ANYONE)
You want to know what anger is?
I tell you, you do not!
For it is a feeling that extinguishes all life,
Destruction and rage is what it has in store for you,
Your soul will be tortured at every last minute,
You waste, with anger's villainy.
Anger swears to muderously end all existence,
And it will threaten everyone and everything,
I tell you now...not to fall into it's cunning trap,
For anger can be devious at times.
And if you fall into it, get out quickly,
For every second in there is a second lost to it's wrath,
Be sure to avoid it poet,
Do not be tempted to serve anger.
