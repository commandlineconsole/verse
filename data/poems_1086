AWESOME DELIGHT
Awesome Delight
The little cloud,
That wanders about
Day and night.
Above the earth
For us to look at,
From life's birth
Glad and sad.
Awesome Delight
Of mist and rain,
Mysterious flight
Without our pain.
Your fallen drops
Soothe every thirst,
So all earth crops
Into bloom burst.
Awesome Delight
I wonder why,
You lose your flight
To fall and die.
