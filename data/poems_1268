DELIGHT 				VAVROOVAHANA PATRA
Moon smiles in the distant firmament:
In Earthy creatures plays waves of merriment.
Beauteous looks the distant mountain:
Melodiously flows the wavy dazzling fountain.
Purity, sanctity, serenity, tranquillity reigns on the shrine:
Devotees enjoy the beauty as drunkards to wine.
Cordiality, fraternity embrace the devotees:
In devotees plays lightening of delight.
Bhagavana embraces the real devotee:
Provides Eternal Peace and Delight.
Bhagavanâ€™s temple is the Heaven on Earth:
Eternally smiles the temple, a Brook of Mirth.
