MY THEORY OF LIFE.
People say life is a box of chocolates or a bowl of cherries.
This is false, so untrue, a lie at its best.
Life is sadness, unfair, unsafe.
Sadness gives us hope,
Unfairness give us happiness,
Being unsafe gives us reason.
So are sadness, unfairness and being unsafe really that horrible.
Sometimes hope, happiness and reason are far worse in the end.
