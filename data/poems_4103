NO THING TO FEAR
Fear source
No where
Fear source
No thing
Fear thought
Cold sweat
Fear thought
Shrieks
Fear dream
No time
Fear dream
No place
What am I afraid of?
What is that?
Fear come and get me
Do it now
Nothing happens..
Suddenly
Sublime grace
All encompassing light
All fear evaporated
New born
This moment
A breath of life
