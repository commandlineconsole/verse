FOLLOW YOUR HEART
Don't rely on friends for advice
Ask your own heart
And if you don't get an answer
Ask it twice
Because friends are overly protective
And in their attempt to steer you clear
They'll saddle your ass with fear
And fear never stopped anyone who shed a tear
Fear is a reason not to try
Fear is watching as life passes by
Fear is another reason to cry
Fear is an alibi
Be brave to look fate in the eye
Be brave to dare
Be brave to persevere and not doubt why
Be brave to try
If you're highly educated or smart
Dare to throw out the knowledge and follow your heart
Becasue smart is overrated
And hearts are not so fated
