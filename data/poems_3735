LASSIE
Everybody likes to love
And to be loved;
But not everybody is lovely.
Some love for dough,
Some love for beauty,
But your love for me
Heals my wound
And refreshes my life’s loneliness.
Everybody likes to care
And to be cared for;
But not everybody is caring.
Some care for evanescence,
Some care for vanity,
But your care for me
Is like morning star
And rekindles my life’s raison d’etre.
