WALK
at night we are stopping
before ourselves
in darkness delighted
with the nudity
and the closeness
of bodies
we are examining
the resistance to the touch
pointing imagination
to secret paths
of delight administered
effectively
as the antispasmodic at dawn
we are dreaming continuation
of the walk of hands...
