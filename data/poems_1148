FIRE
Burn,
Burn brightly,
Oh such delight,
This fire brings me,
The flicker of this flame,
The shape it holds,
Is so untamed,
Fire,
Oh how you delight me so,
Such fantastic wonders to behold,
But your beauty comes with a price,
Fire burns and it causes pain,
Thats if you live thru it,
Whats the reason,
That the beauty of fire,
Draws us to it,
Even thou it causes pain,
Its beauty compells us to it,
Oh such beauty,
We call it fire.
