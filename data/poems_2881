SADNESS
Its 8: 00 in the morning
Why does my heart feel so cold?
The rain won’t stop falling
Where did my sunshine go?
The birds refuse to sing
For grey clouds cover the sky
Sadness takes over everything
Then the roses begins to cry
Even the trees are bent badly
There was silence everywhere
The wind whistles sadly
Even my dog shed a tear
Well back to bed I go
Turned my fan back on
Wake me up hmmm I don’t know
Maybe when sadness is gone
