A CHARMING WORLD
Enter in this world's case
And in this winning place
And try to learn the art
To push this charming cart
With fun and joy and hope
To sway away the mope
For life has some dull sights
And also few scenes bright
And know that in this way
Life shows shades of blue and gray
And sometimes also colours right
Makes this charming world bright
Where water flows and sun shines
And flower blooms to spread joy's wine
So we can all spend hours of leisure
with lots of joy, happiness and pleasure
So enter charmly in world's case
And win smile and cheer in this place.
