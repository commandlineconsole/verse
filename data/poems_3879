WITH NO CARE
With No Care
I stepped on roses
And now, my feet bleed
The pain of guilt is the stuck thorn
And will never be pulled
I see their smiles
And they'll never be the same
The guilt and shame
With No Care
I never thaught
I never knew
But if I did, I would've never walked
And time can't be replayed
Before, I was awaiting to fade
I am years late
With Care
I am death awaiting
I am the thorn
I am the one you think of
With No Care
