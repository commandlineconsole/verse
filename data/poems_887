JOY
The green grasses are gone
The taverns were burnt
Happiness walked away
Holding joy along the trail
Sorrow intervened with its lethal weapon
And stabbed the heart of a better future
Disheartened was it, the minds of folks
Lamenting sorrowfully and felt so bored
The kids was filled with depression
And the adults deserted their ambition
The palace was empty
And the market was filled with sadist
The voice of a kid was heard so low
Thus said''all i want is joy not woe''
Days went on with sorrowful moments
And rulers submitted their precious government
Hoping joy would never come back
To split fortunes on their path
Suddenly emerge the green grasses
And sorrow absconded from our path
Its sword was broken
Our door was opened
Approaching was it happiness and joy
And impacted in the life of the indefatigable boys
Our kingdom was an epitome of love
And eliminated was it the times we sob
Our cribs was so interesting
And our heart, filled with ecstasy
The joy we desire is now with us
Happiness, which we seek is dining with our folks
We are so happy and feel so exciting
We share our love and our precious tiding
