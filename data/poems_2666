THE SADNESS DOES NOT END
THE SADNESS DOES NOT END/ THE DEATHS DO NOT STOP COMING
The sadness does not end-
The deaths do not stop coming-
If you want to be free of this
Do not grow old-
Do not know many people
Do not in fact be human-
The deaths do not stop coming
The sadness does not end-
How better to be young and mindless than old and full of so many memories of lost friends-
