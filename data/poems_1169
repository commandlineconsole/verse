MY DOG IS MY DELIGHT
My dog is my delight
So willing to love me
And do everything
that I want him to do
for me
Yes he is my delight
He understands me
When I'm down
He just can't tell me
What to do about it
He shows me what to
do about it
Honestly he really
Understands
He licks my tears
To stop me from crying
He snuggles with me to
Keep me warm when I'm
Cold
He let's me know when
Danger is near
He really understands
Me
He's not tired doing so
Either
It didn't take much for me
To know that he is
Much more than a friend
