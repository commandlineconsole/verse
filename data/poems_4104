FOOLS  LIVE IN FEAR, BRAVES IN LOVE
If we have gold we are in great fear
If we don't have anything we are in danger
And the sage says love is full of fear
Completely blind and has no reason
The sage says fear is the heart's prison
Fear is stronger than love
As it begets prudence and takes  care of.
Wise lives in courage  fools in fear
Lovers are not  cowards or fools either.
Fear has a quick ear but can not hear
Fear has wings but can't fly
Love in  a cage  can't live but die
Fear and fools falter, love conquers all
A fool  distinguishes man  but love equals all
