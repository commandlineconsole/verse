HEAVENLY PRESENCE
A feeling very heavenly
Is your presence in my life, I feel so blessed.
So blessed I feel, now that you have come as a nightingale in my life
Since, only because of your love, I am able to smile
Happy, you have always made me by bringing joy.
The joy in my life is because of you as you add hope
By showering me with beautiful feeling of your love
Which touches my heart, to leave a presence very heavenly
Which adds a joy to my life
Through your presence, since you are the joy
Heavenly, you turn my world to be
Makes me feel blessed, your sweet love is all that I desire
Thinking about you makes me happy
You are the joy of my life
Heavenly, is your presence and the feeling of it is truly beautiful.
