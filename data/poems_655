YOUR BEGINNING AND MY END
the beginning with no end
you say your love for me is forever
your love is eternal
thee is no end
the end with no beginning
I say my love for you is not forever
my love is not eternal
there is no begining
as your music begins
my music ends
as your passion  burns
my passion is extinguished
as you are born and reborn
I   leave the cycle of life
and when you become a goddess
I shall be no more
