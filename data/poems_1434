MOTHER’S LAP 						VAVROOVAHANA PATRA
Mother Mangala is Deity;
Penetrates rays of Gaiety.
Is an Ocean of Delight;
Evaporates life’s plight.
Mother shows the right path;
Is a Brook of mirth.
Tranquilises the devotee;
Is the Almighty.
Fragrance of Shrine Kisses the devotees;
Devotees dance with delight.
Cuckoo sings delightfully;
Sun ray kisses the shrine gaily.
Mother’s altar is a brook of nectar;
Devotees drink, content their desire.
Devotees smile gaily;
Children play delightfully.
Moon beam kisses the shrine at night;
Mother penetrates rays of delight.
Laps sons affectionatively;
Poets derive Divine Bliss gaily.
