TECHNOLOGY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY SON
Technology is what he sees as most important above all things
The phone it rings and oh it brings
Instant Depression
So what's the lesson?
You aren't important, I don't care about you
I'm only concerned with what Facebook can do
I only care about these internet strangers
Doesn't matter to me that you're in danger
I hate you, you bother me, and you're a nuisance and a problem child
The computer is my main concern; my friends on there are wild
They are cool and fun, you talk too much and you take medication
You are "crazy", you aren't sane in this or any nation
Did you take your pills? Cause you're actin' goofy
You are a loser and you act loopy!
I am infallible and perfect, you are not
All I care about is the computer spot
You're crazy and boring and loud
Of you there is nothing to be proud
You're a failure and a black sheep
I'm going to throw you away, I could never keep
I only care about my technology
I turn my back to the death of "my family"!
