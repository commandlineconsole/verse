PLEASURE AND PAIN
The pain he gave her, was also his pleasure
Before she felt it, she was his treasure
He changed everyday, a second or two
She figured out that her man was untrue
She would always call her man a charmer
What happened to the man in shining armor
When they first started talking he was so sweet
When they got married, she felt complete
She felt like her man was jus a pretend
She prayed and hoped that this nightmare would end
She found out her man was deceit, when she found out he had cheat
In the end she felt defeat
But what can come between pleasure and pain
A healthy relationship is sometimes hard to maintain
