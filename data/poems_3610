OH BEAUTIFUL
For politics, politics, every ‘Morning Joe' we should
Be watching and taking advantage of the get smarter
Opportunities to understand the process  between
Politicians and their fellow travelers  -  you and me.
There's a party  war  that is always going on under
Spacious skies and far too many get their kicks out
Of waging those wars rather than the keep-it-simple-
Stupid  concerns of we the people while our amber
Waves of grain  are dying of drought  along with the
Fruited plains.  Most of us can't afford to go witness
First-hand the purple mountains majesty and never
Mind those patriot dreams or crowning the good
With brotherhood from s ea to polluted  sea, America.
The politicians and their party-goers need to work on
A lack of self awareness before opening their mouths
And pocketbooks, and while we're on the subject,
There is a money shortage in most American homes,
With what's owed being greater than what we make,
Earn, receive.  That is the major concern of ‘We the
People' and   our elected officials should be focusing
On that and their intent, integrity and can the debate
About the ‘signs of success.'  We'll let you know as
Soon as we become one.
God sheds Grace on all of us and we've got to shine
A light on what it is that lifts us up and brings us to
Our knees when we go independently to VOTE.
There are two choices and setting party  foolishness
Aside, we the individual thinking Republicans and
Democrats; T-Party and Independents; nay-sayers
And free-thinkers will upset the hard-liners on
Election day 2012, to the good all concerned.
