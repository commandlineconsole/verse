FRIENDSHIP BROKEN
You said you’d help me
You said you got my back
I heard you laugh
Why would you do that?
I cried in your arms
And I trusted you with the words I said
I let you in and I thought you were my friend
How could you
Why would you
I heard you laugh and my heart just stopped
My sadness turns to hate
No looking back
It’s on now
As I take a drag
I think of ways to hurt you
The hate builds up ‘the pain of a broken friendship seeps in
After my tears day up form the sadness
And turn to hate
They fall down again for the very last time
