FEAR NOT
O thou shackled soul,
Fear Not the light for darkness is blinding,
Fear Not the blindness for vision is incomplete,
Fear Not the incompleteness for complete is tainted,
Fear Not the taint for disgrace is bigger,
fear but the strength of your fears,
the depth of your unconscious faith,
and the company of your tears.
