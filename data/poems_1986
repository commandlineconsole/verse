FRUIT FAIRY - ERASERHEADS
Magic in the vine, sugar when i cook
Shake and bake the flavor
Come and take a look
Nuts, nuts, nuts, nuts everywhere
Berries and wine so divine
They grow in my hair
[Chorus]
It aint easy being a fruit fairy
Fruits are flights of fancy
Just think
Fruitcakes aint no fruitcakes without me
Here, take this wand wave it in the air
Surprise, surprise that really is my spatula
All day long i tend the garden
Talk to the leaves and dig the sun (dig)
[repeat Chorus]
All day long i tend the garden
Eat the bugs and water the plants
Smoke em weed
[repeat Chorus except last 2 words]
Ain't no fruitcake without me
Ahh
[repeat Chorus]
