I CRY, MY TEARS
My tears, i cry
i cry, my tears
'cause of a fear
the fear i will never be able to fly(like an angel)
My tears i cry ONLY when im not giving in
When im hearing...
me and someone else crying
hummm(my little brother)
Where does crying get me? !
crying ONLY gets me another fear
the fear is a glear in my eyes and in my eyes
is the tear that i cry
Tears and ccries
are part lies that i hearand...
part fears
that i fear.
The tears i cry are....
what people say about my life
The tears i fear are the fears of...
