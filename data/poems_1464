THE ROAD TO DANGER
Life is full of pleasure
Pleasure without measure
And it is of human nature
To seek pleasure without nurture
Life has its own hidden treasure
The one free of any danger
One that doesn't give any seizure
And doesn't  cause any anger
But many chase after the outer gain
One that results in endless pain
They forget attitude is what to train
To win the race on the victorious lane
Excess pleasure lives among danger
Be to it a  total stranger
Or else it might end up being you killer
And your life might end much earlier
