THE FIRE INSIDE ME
inside me there's a firery secert
and something that you will regerct.
like the sun buring
the anger inside me will never stop
i will never forgett that day
even if today is anew day
i  can never revel the ture me agin
coz you will just laugh
inside me there's a firery secert
and something that you will regerct.
like the sun buring
the anger inside me will never stop
