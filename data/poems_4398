FEAR
Fear is a killing machine
It has been twisted by people to use on others
Our society strives to drive fear through you,
Maybe to even kill you
The Church has made a living through fear
They have killed innocent people just for their self-righteous gains
They even try condeming people so they will do their ugly biddings
Politicans are the same
They use their high position for their own doings
They say stay out of their game or else
But I won't leave them alone
I will always stay around and criticize their wrongdoings
I will make you see what I mean
Someday I'll show you that fear drives the world we live
Someday I'll show you
