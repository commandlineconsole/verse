FEARS
Fears everyone has
No spiders, snakes, night crawlers
No monsters, ghouls, creatures of goo
No
Real fears
Fears everyone has
Not being accepted
Not being known
Not being the center of attention
The fears none know
The fears all have
All hide behind fear
All hide behind lies
They lie and know not the reason
Their once true self gets buried and changed
They become drowned in their fears
They lie and cheat
They fear
They hide themselves
And show others the things that will draw them into attention
Made up or not
Bragging
Lying
Falling
Soon to believe their own lies
All because:
Fears
