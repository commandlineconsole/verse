SURPRISES, SURPRISES
Evoke your heart with
Surprises, surprises,
Because in a poem
There are a lot of disguises.
Where they start
Is up to you,
Do your part
And read what's true.
For the truth is in
Every lyrical line,
And only you can begin
To make those words shine.
Evoke your heart with
Surprises, surprises,
And all those rimes
Shall throw your dices.
For what is not seen
Should also be there,
So it has been
For what you read here.
