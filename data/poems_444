RAIN OF PASSION
rain falls in a steady torrent from heaven
appeasing the thirst of the earth
but just as steadily
awakening the arousing hunger of desire
between two mortal souls
as rain slicked flesh glide
over
around
and thru
each other
sodden clothes hang transparently
from bodies in need of intimate contact
more than air to breathe
hands caress
pushing
pulling
even ripping
the barriers that separate them
from their desired goal
fingers
mouths
and tongues
speak rhymes
and inscribe glyphs
of passions and need so ancient
they are known only intuitively
thru the collective subconscious
from which all souls are born
mouths and tongues incant their desires
across breasts and nipples
fingers Braille their need
to know
to have
to take
across rain soaked flesh
seeking the passion drenched center of
ecstasy's impending storm
moans and sighs
lost in the wail
of thunder and rain
one storm's passion feeding the other
as rain falls more heavily
bodies glide and collide
grinding in a frenzied dance
of raw need and
primitive possession
tongues taste skin slick with
rain
sweat
passion
and somethingâ€¦.
pure
unadulterated
uniquely her
voices cry out hoarsely
to the heavens
demanding the attention
of constellations
gods and angels
to bare witness
to the culmination
of ancient passions
blending
melding
melting
with raindrops
and flowing
thru the veins
of satisfied lovers
