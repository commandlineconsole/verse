SUPERFICIAL
Sitting all the way across the room from you
There are people around but it's like we're the only two
Only two in this room, only two in the world
It's all the same to this hopeless girl
He doesn't care who she is, or what she thinks of him
He just wants to have a little a fun, so he can finally 'win'
He won't care what happens when this day is done
All he cares about is having a little fun
But she cares what his reasons are and she cares what will happen after
And she cares about the flirting, the smiles and the laughter
She wants to know he wants her for reasons that aren't obvious
Like the colour of her eye shadow or the size of her jeans from guess
She wants him to take the time to make her laugh and smile before she commits
And she wants to judge him on the way he behaves and the thoughts he submits
But if nothing happens on this glorious night it would be okay with her
But it wouldn't be okay with him because it's a waste of a night searching for a 'partner'
Because she has a vision of them stuck inside her head that could fade with one bad wish for all
Because now she starting to see his reasons are superficial
