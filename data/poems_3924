TRUST
My heart and soul belongs to you
I give you my heart
for you to hold
Lift me with kindness if words
Just to let me know you you care
My heart is so fragile
With one wrong move it could break
So care of what you say
For my heart might just break
So I give you my heart
to love and protect
to handle with care
So take care of it while in your grasp
So I may live in harmony at last.
