YVONNE
Who’s gonna take care of the children
Now that she is gone
Who’s gonna see that all the little babies
Will somehow get along
Who’s gonna take care of the children
When the time has come to say goodbye
When the little babies start to cry
Who’s gonna be right there to wipe their eyes
Now that she is gone
Yes I know that it’s a hurting tragedy
But death to everyone is guaranteed
Life isn’t promised to any one of us
So we must learn to deal with reality
Who’s gonna take care of the children
Who’s gonna be there when they call
Who’s gonna help them when they fall
Who’s gonna take care of the children
When the little babies start to cry
Who’s gonna be right there to wipe their eyes
Who, tell me who, please God tell me who
I’ve tried to do the best I can
They’ve all been fathered by different men
Who’s gonna take care of the children
Dear God you know I love them so
I gotta take my son and I must go
Yvonne, I’ll always love you
I just can’t stop thinking of you
Reach out, please tell me girl
Who’s gonna take care of the children
Now that you are gone
