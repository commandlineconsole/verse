FEAR OF MY THOUGHTS
You make me fear the thoughts in my brain
For the things I think
Of you
Thoughts which are't to be thought
Things which will never occur
I fear the thoughts in my mind
For they are things I long for
Things I know will never happen
Becasue you and I can't happen
I fear the thoughts inmy mind
because you are there every time
I can't visit my own mind
My own thoughts sadden me and enrich me with anger
Am angry atmelf
I fear my own thoughts
Just because it has what I want
Because I'm green with envy at it
Because you're there and not out here
I fear my own thoughts...
