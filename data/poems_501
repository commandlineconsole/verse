LET GO THE PASSION
memories come and go,
my rocking chair work out the flow.
Sweet fire keep the cold heart warm,
away from blurry past and the storm.
Sweet child she was, so,
crawling here and there and go.
I remember when settled in my arms,
that smile, ever full of charms.
Let go the passion, man,
this is not your track or way.
Let go the passion, man,
no rerun of times or replay.
Growing up so fast now,
spreading love by the vow.
Hatred didn't know this place,
that lies inside her with the grace.
A teenager now, full of hopes,
full of dreams beyond my scopes.
You became like her number one fan,
you're thirty and she's ninteen, man.
Let go the passion, man,
this is not your track or way.
Let go the passion, man,
no rerun of times or replay.
Looks like a taboo of some sort,
no touch, no smile of that sort.
The sleeping beauty that I missed,
is a full grown woman out of nest.
Her own house, her own man,
her own universe is on the span.
Same laughter still shine through,
despite the age, she really never grew.
Let go the passion, man,
this is not your track or way.
Let go the passion, man,
no rerun of times or replay.
Let go the passion man,
your hopes are not for today.
Let go the passion man,
your dreams, down should lay.
down, should lay...
