THE GREATEST JOYS IN LIFE
The Greatest Joys in Life
The greatest joys in life are being a parent
To watch your children grow and learn
To get the hugs and kisses every day
To give them hugs and kisses in return
To spend every moment with them
To guide them down the right path
Cherish every minute you can
See them cry and see them laugh
We never say goodbye
Because we know they will be back
The greatest joys in life
Are the joys when they come back
It may be hard at first when they leave
To hear them say they are going
Even if its for six weeks
It feels like a lifetime
The tears will come rolling down
Each and every day they are gone
Because they are my life I live for now
They are my pride and joy forever
I didnâ€™t think it would be so hard to see
Them wave to me as they drove away
With tear drops rolling down my cheeks
Even though they will have fun all day
My love for them is unconditional
No matter what they have done
My children mean the world to me
Always and forever in time
I can not wait to see them again
As the tears will turn to joy
And I have them in my arms again
The greatest joys in life
