SURPRISE
strong winds blows
memories n dreams juxtapose
Why aren't you here
I miss you so much dear
As I sat writing you a letter
the pages went helter-skelter
and you appear just out of dreams
Beautiful again, the world seems
Oh what a wonderful surprise
Are you real
My imagination I surmise
my effervescent scream
Not a single word you utter
Encompass me in your embrace
and slowly tilt my face
Me, waiting for a kiss, feelings aflutter
Never knew love can be fatal
Lovers embrace so lethal
sacrificed on altar of greed
By my lover
A nice surprise indeed!
