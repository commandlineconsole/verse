SORROW SINS &LOVE;
Stories that never been told.Bitter feelings never been express.Security that never was secure.Confussion and Knowledge not to be told. Emotions cut short, lives that can't be restored Sorrow Sins&Love;
A son who looks like his father A daughter who's sed and a mothers sins.The past is to deep as if it eas throwning water.A soldier who is loyal to defend the one thing he loves.Sorrow Sins &Love;
Addiction more powerful then drugs love that never been found, wounds that can't heal.A bowl that can't be filled. Sorrow Sins & Love.
Math problems never to solved forgiveness as black as this ink im writting with.Unexplained theories and music without sound. How we express our misfortunes. How can we subside our doubt.
Sins only the devil can understand Sorrow in which jesus weep love knowing one day it would be ecknowledge.
These indregients can't bake a cake but know how will determinate the comfortablity.Those who know the story hold the truth.Look towarf the future to find a better you.Sorrow brings happiness Sins you can repent and Love cover all things.
