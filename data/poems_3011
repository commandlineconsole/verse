BLACK DAY
Darkness with no light
Work with no rest
Labour with no pay
Again, Again and all over Again
Sorrows that surrounds us
With thought of sadness in our heart
We crumble to the dark
Hoping to find the light at the end
A game of undisputed sorrow
Slowly moves
Slowly crumble to the ground
Slowly departed with different aim
Different shepeard brought to flock different sheeps
Different game
With different rules
Darkness still surrounds
Hoping to see the dawn
The dawn that never comes
Catastrophe by day
Sorrows and sadness by night
Humilation, sorrows, pain and sadness are what appears
When will there be a breaking dawn?
When will the cat be let out of the bag?
When will the catastrophe of pain and sorrows end?
Is there any world out there apart from this darkness?
The reverse might be the case
