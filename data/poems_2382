LETS PROMOTE PEACE
Can I give u some advice, don't be angry
you can't fight anger with anger,
you can't fight ignorance with hate
you can't put out a fire by throwing fuel  on it
true we want peace, so let's encourage peace
laugh, smile be happy, do what u do
dance, sing, be merry
but don't be angry
Don't give in to the terror
don't be like them, don't be angry
Trust me I know, its a disease
it won't go away, and it grows and grows
Yes we will fight, but not with anger
not like an animal, not like that beast
Don't serve that beast
Their is a purpose, a mission
reach out to the heart of others
there must be education, enlightenment
let us promote peace
but don't be angry, let it go
If u were to wash someones heart,
like a stone idol is washed outwardly
the hate will be removed
the soul will be cleansed
dont let the anger sit in your mind
don't let him sit their,
keep that seat; for peace of mind
the calm mind, that will bring peace
within you, and  outside of you
