I LOVE YOU [SO CLICHE BUT SMILEY]
i love the way you talk
i love the way you walk
i love the way you balk
at the idea of hurting me
i love it when we kiss
i love this absolute bliss
i love knowing that this
is nowhere close to ending
i love the way you stand
i love when you hold my hand
i love everything you do and
all of the wonderful things you say
i love the way you smile
i love your hair and your style
i love it that im worthwhile
to you, even when others say im not
i love it that you love me
i love it that i make you happy
i love all the things i see
and the things inside you
I LOVE YOU
