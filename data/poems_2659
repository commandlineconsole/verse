TRIGGERING DISPLACEMENT
Distance and spaces fill the empty sadness, triggering displacement in my every day life.
Changing times never changing my interior sadness, no matter what crosses my vision at any time.
Incalcuable thoughts, caressing my heart as it cries out for your love, wishing the ocean's tides will reunite us once again.
Pounding waves reminding me that you are no longer here, but waving to me from afar.
Distance and spaces filling empty sadness as they trigger displacement in my life every day.
