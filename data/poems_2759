YEAR OF THE SADNESS
year of the sadness
In year of the sadness I bury my words
The flowers set out and not remains
some thing becomes sated for personal
Not remains any a star in a night
plays with my drop
and become love and no love
and run my love! !
Crazy straying is sleepless
He mourns to the night his drunks
To the love he talks
He talks my sufferance with the world
And slip still remember,
and how much my slips...
A pen became weary of slumbers
Between the lines and my word
In year I hid my page in
and return back to you as i promisd,
O nicest season in my narration
