WHERE THERE IS LOVE
There is no fog of life.
Love love love love
Tell openly declare openly
You love you love you love.
It is love that is life
It is life that is in love.
Love love love love
Love is not attachment
Love is liberation.
You are in love
That means you are
Free from all sins
And you are everything.
