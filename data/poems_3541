TEACHER
A man without ego
A man with concern
Do good for better
There are few
Teach about personality
Without personality
Tear the poor
Protect the rich
And perform as advocates
Not of the rich
But of the havenots
They sympathise in the presence
And mock at in the absence
If somebody stood against
It was the end
End End End
Without gain
But pain
They please the authorities
And remove the mask
Because they gain
What they need
I saw few
Who considers everybody
Without a wall
They consider
They hear
Notonly the haves
But the havenots too.
Respect teachers
Not based on their profession
But on their actions
And living words
Beware beware the psudoes
They are only by profession
Not by actions
What a contradiction!
Being with the woolf
Who is in sheep
Open your eyes
Controle your tongue
Otherwise you will be taught
How to trap a person.
