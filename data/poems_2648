HIGH
Enough of sadness
Now, I am dreaming of love
Love, I imagine to be in
To love and be loved is my desire
Want to love and never end it
Moments of sadness have been enough
Now, I am back with only one desire, which is to love
No more crying, only some pleasurable moments of love are to be
Passion will be high as I will endlessly love in my imagination
Dream to love, the beautiful girl of my dreams
Enough of sadness, only love.
