THERE IS THIS SADNESS THAT BRINGS......
there is this sadness that i want
to give to you
but of course, you shall not accept it
for who is foolish enough
to welcome sadness when all hopes
of our humanity are pinned
on happiness?
but there is this sadness that makes us silent
and responsible upon our own shoulders
there is this sadness that makes us
fully human, and fully alive,
there is this sadness that brings you literature
and poetry
and then all those fame and fortune that you
have been seeking
there is this sadness which has another consequence
the purification of the soul
the everlasting happiness
shall you not take it now?
