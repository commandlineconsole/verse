HOW THE ROSE ATTRACTED THE NOSE
Blithe somewhere about the rose
drew attention to the nose
to visit it to get close
to it and put in repose
the savor of its fragrance.
Pleasure nice is the instance,
which the nose felt resonance
of the rose in effulgence.
Says the nose, “Sweet is the taste
of the fragrance from the chaste
rose, I’ll continue to paste
to my pleasure, vastly placed.”
