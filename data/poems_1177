CHARMING SUNSET
Sitting by the rocks
I watch the Sun go down,
Bidding adieu,
in its scarlet gown
Leaving today, to welcome Night,
which comes in its garment white
The breeze, blowing, brings delight
seeing the starry sky so bright	My soul, delighted, soars above
to reach the haven of  boundless love,
Where none is yours, and none mine,
where everything, is Love, divine
My heart searches, for someone, though
with whom, to there, I will go
If not today, then someday else
I'll see what my life foretells.
