MY SADNESS IS WHO I AM ALSO
MY SADNESS IS WHO I AM ALSO
My sadness is who I am also-
It weighs in me-
It sinks through my eyes-
Even in my laughter and joy
It complicates and questions-
Sadness is so so deep in me-
Why I do not know.
I see my fatherâ€™s eyes in me
In all mirrors-
Grief is for the long gone and long ago-
Part of Sadness is this also.
