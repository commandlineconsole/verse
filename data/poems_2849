MY MOTHER SAID
one day
as i almost
died laughing my
mother said
not to laugh
out loud because
the volume
of my laughter
shall be
the same
volume
of sadness
and tears
that follows
after
take moderation
she said
do not howl
or wail
do not have
a brouhaha
take the
little giggle
and the smile
take
the little pinch
of pain
in happiness
and sadness
let there
be caution
like day
and night
not so glaring
not so gloomy
live in twilight
stay in dusk
