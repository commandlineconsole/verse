SILENCE
I see your strength
in your silence
oh wise one
where have you gone
i see your strength
in your beauty
oh great one
i see you
it is pure delight
that i know of you
I see your strength
in your muscles
oh magnificent one
I see your strength
in your peacefullness
it is pure delight
that i can say
i know of you
