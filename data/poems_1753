ROTARY LIFE
This day. this night, the thought nought, dilly dally
The life that coats a lot of pain on pleasure
And pleasure on pain has  shades,  subtle, wide.
This  song ‘ong’ shall long linger in my eyes
Me thinks its time to wipe my tears and smile
At everything dark and light, this subtle while.
All alone the pregnant earth lives a rotary life
What a pity, the wine that was brewed of molten things
Have all been drunk – the green did  smell strangely yesterday..
