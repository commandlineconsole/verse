THE ANATOMY
The anatomy surprises me with its contours,
The map of heaven has unfurled forever;
It is the academy of the body that belabours,
With fright at its heels and talking thoughts at the mind.
One anatomy is another anatomy,
Frames light up to end the ways of men.
Death has been picture and pen,
Pens and ink, pencils and lead.
The surprise of our future can highlight
Distinction and reading of the lights so coloured.
