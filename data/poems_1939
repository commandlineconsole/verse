LIFE
A day may pass without anything surprising happening
But when you turn around the corner
There may be a surprise waiting for you
A day may pass without a happy moment
But when you turn around the corner
Happiness is just there waiting for you
Somedays there are sadness
When the day do come
Look around you to your friends
& family they are always there for you

Somedays there's anger
Often in a fit of anger we do
& say things we regret later
But others have already been hurt by you
This is life my friends
Life is full of ups & downs
Never let them get you down
It's hard but this is life
