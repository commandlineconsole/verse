LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES
Life is full of surprises for me
And I know that there are some good and bad ones because I am aware of That myself
But I have trouble dealing with the bad surprises in life because I have Problem inhandling it
But whenthe good surprises comes in life I use it all and I try to get the Most out of it
Like writting poetry, taking pictures, sleeping and so on
