WHAT ARE WE BARBARIANS?
Why are some of us always willing to help others
while some of us are
more concerned with themselves?
Why are some of us always ready to answer the call
when called upon while others are more concerned
with the time it would take away from their own lives?
Why are some of us never judgemental while some of us
only judge and condemn?
Some of us know the answer and follow the right path
because once a long time ago we were asked a question
by our Father.
He looked at each of us and asked all of us,
'After all, what are we Barbarians? '
Some of us understood the question right away
and our answer was simple as we replied, 'No we are not'
While some of us struggled with the answer and picked apart the question and tried to reply with a more complex answer to justify our
reasoning
And some of us still struggle with the answer today
