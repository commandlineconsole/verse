LOSTED SOULS
Welcome all you losted souls
fairies and gnomes
take glass of sweet smirnoff
feel stolischnaya in your mouth
join to trebak and let rythm of
balalaika lead your steps
gather around the fire
feel flames dancing in your hearts
twisted minds
drink, drink it’s time for joy
drown your sorrow’s to bottle
of magical joy
let trebak lead your steps
and forget all in past
forget saddness, sorrow and worries
we may have only this moment
so live, live and enjoy
taste, smell and touch
everything you see
to make you feel alive again..
