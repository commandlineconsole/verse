WHEN THE CITY LIGHTS PERISH
and the glamour of the city
shall one day fade away
corrupted souls
uncanny woes
shall then bathe the streets
with echoes
and the vanity of the pavements
shall one day crumble
crash down the underground
with pieces of jealousy
and teardrops of lament
and the dictates of the void
lay upon the beast of time
entrenched sorrow
banging in heartless ensemble
racing to the oblivion of crime
and the sorrow of the wicked
shall overrule
taste the darklands of torture
lay in anxiety and unending conceit
watch in stillness
and absorb its beat
as this city shall come forth -
and one day fade away..
