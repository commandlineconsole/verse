LOVE AND TRAGEDY
Yes, I have loved with love
Drove myself mad with this love
Hoping to catch a glimpse of my love
Just seeing was not enough for me
So I met her, my true love,
Yes, I married this girl with joy
The splendid sense of so much joy
And I felt so much,
Going to sleep with her, my true joy,
Yes, I watched this girl die with sorrow
The fire that did it also ignited my sorrow
And there was nothing to console this sorrow
Even still into tomorrow,
No cope in hope to borrow,
Going to sleep without my love,
Yes, I heard those gruesome tolls alone
I stood looking at her stone while alone
Minding on what to do, now that I'm alone,
Listening to the bells of malicious tones,
Those horrifying, loud drones,
Those dreadful, terrible moans,
Those agonizing, tumultuous groans,
No one left, no one here,
I was happy once, but now I hear
And my joy and my love,
Is now so far above,
May I hope she rests in peace,
Even through my pain's increase of sorrow
Where I will still be alone, truly alone,
