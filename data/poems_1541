ONE NIGHT
Watchin from afar, waiting for your chance
It all started with a simple dance
Your eyes caught my attention
Curious to find your definition
Wondering the heights
We can reach on the warm fall nights
Just you and me
The pleasure we can receive
Experience the intensity
Forgetting about simplicity
The sexual attraction is undeniable
Sensual pleasure is unmistakably reliable
Waking in your arms surrounding
Within my petite body, climax is arousing
To utopia you continuously send
Never wanting this to come to an end
Pleasure so extreme making me loose sight
Words do not give justice to our one night
