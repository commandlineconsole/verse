RACHEL(THIS GIRL)
Rachel(this girl)
please dont leave me
your like a potato
i need to put you in the fridge
you atre too hot you burn my heart
please dont leave me
you like a passion fruit
because you have passion
you must be god
because you send me to heaven(because of your passion like a passion fruit)
when we touch
i can feel PASSION
like when i touch a passion fruit
electricity sparks between us
like when you get an electric shock(but one that doesnt hurt)
