THE HORSES ARE COMING
Lynette was a beautiful baby
A true joy to her ma and pa
Free from original sin she was
The whole family was in awe
She was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
One day she woke with fever
There was snow and wind and cold
The car was stuck at the end of the drive
To the doctor they could not go
She was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
Quick hook-up the team and the sleigh
By horse she'll surely make it
Quick hook-up the team and the sleigh
Let's take some time to say how much truly we love you
She was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
Manes a flyin' tales a whippin'
The horse's plowed right through
Muscles a bulgin' and hides a sweating
Let's take some time to say how much we truly love you
She was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
Well by horse they surely made it
By horse they surely did
By horse they surely told 'em
There was nothing they could do for her
But she was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
Well, for all those ma's and pa's out there
Who've lost their little ones
This songs not about a child dying
But of her parent's love
She was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
She was loved loved loved
One day on earth is just the same
as one year, fifty or a hundred
The only difference my friends
Is in the love you're
givin' and receivin'
Love love love
Love love love
Love love love
Love love love
Hold on Lynette the horses are coming
Let's take some time to say how much we truly love you
