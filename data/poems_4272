BULLETS
war is the action mankind takes
for fear of knowing God! ...
an actual fear of living.
we fear death, not because it's
the end, but because we havent lived!
and so it's 'easier' for us to kill our
neighbors than to face ourselves,
and see ourselves in other peoples...
we fear God, we fear life and death,
and we're terrified of ourselves!
