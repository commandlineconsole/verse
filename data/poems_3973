WHO CARES?
Who Cares?
As I sit here broken all alone
Glistening tears fall on my floor
As I sit here crying all forelone
No one cares for me ever at all

As I sit here I want a hug
With no mates to try and phone
I’m just constantly a pathetic mug
No one cares sorry I shouldn't groan

As I sit here I’m just pathetic
Feeling I don’t belong or ever will
Forced to act strong and energetic
No one cares as I so strong if I feel ill

As I sit here all hope gone
Choking lumps formed in my chest
As I sit my worthlessness my song
No one cares for I’m just a pest

As I sit here no one here
Reason for my existence I doubt
I have no purpose here as I fear
Who cares if my life just blows out
