ANTIQUITY
When sadness becomes monumental
When only tears can fall
We cannot look upon you
As an ordinary mortal
Because you had the vision of soul
To share your love with your fellow-beings
In ways that caused appreciation to bloom
To full flower
To bloom at a timely hour
You left us living what you
had lived to become
A common grief was born
This grief was not met with scorn
This grief evoked a massive common emotion
Because sadness became monumental
Because only tears would fall
Even though your sun has set
May you forever be rooted
In the land mines of antiquity.
