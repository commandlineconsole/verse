DARLING SPRING
Come here again darling spring
In fragrance of sights and beauty
With birds that lovely will sing
Forever with passion and carefree
Everything comes from under snow
Leaves and grasses become green
Summer breezing tender to blow
Giving its pleasures in scent keen
Darling I dreamt you last night
In wonderful gardens somewhere
The blooming came back so bright
Summer's sweet notions in air
Recreation of pleasures to know
For thoughts that once were apart
New morning so fresh in its glow
And giving a song to my heart
Come here again darling spring
I will be here expecting for you
When moods of winter upswing
All my thoughts will be in sky blue
