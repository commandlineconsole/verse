STUDENTS OF LIFE
I want to fly
Fly higher then no man or woman has ever tried
To see heights at a new surprise
To dig deep from the ground
To rise and never fall down
To think higher, faster, better then the average man
To see things people donâ€™t want you to see
Look past the shadows of a person
To see whats really inside
Love, hate, anger, confidence it want be a surprise
To be better than life itself
To teach those who knows nothing of you
Teach the education of being free not held to nothing
I am the teacher who taught how it feels to not knowing anything it all
We are all students searching and trying to figure out and get the finer things in life
We are human
