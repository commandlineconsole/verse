Y..... LIGHT DELIGHT
A fluff white cloud and a branch of lush casuarina,
Glorious bliss to the eye, wonderfully pure
Breezily dancing like a gracious ballerina,
Painted on the late morning sky of soft azure
Sheer and wild delight
Flows through my veins
Pushing firmly aside
Any sorrow or pains
The sun stands high over a heavenly sea
The green of the tree in yellowish rays
Celestial blue over snow-white breaking waves
What a rejoice, these resplendent light plays
The child in me jumps up inside
My soul is bathing  in its delight
Fascinating nature, fine and bright
A stunning game  of love and light
