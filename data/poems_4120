FEAR
Fear loses when I am close to you,
when I forget about what is loneliness,
but lately you are the one I fear,
now the world is my nightmare.
I've lost the one who protected me,
from all the fear which could rule in me,
now I am exposed,
to my nightmare every night, and everyday.
I fear what you've done to me,
I fear that's true,
that it's not just a nightmare,
that's just my reality.
I fear for it to happen again,
I fear the pain that have grown in my heart,
I fear for it to get worst,
I fear for it to take me to an end.
I fear not to have you one more time,
for our dreams to disappear for once and for all,
I fear for what's happening now,
and I fear it's not just a nightmare.
