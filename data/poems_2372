O MY DESIRE, O MY ANGER
O my desire O my anger
I was here in very good condition
Before your arrival
And now I am in disaster.
O my desire O my anger
Without giving prior notice
You have appeared
Your appearance is illegal
And only for false pleasure.
O my desire O my anger
Roll back your number
I am not satisfied at your works
And actually I am in fear.
