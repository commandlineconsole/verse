TRANSFORMING
Leaping off the bus
Cutting in front of people to fling open the doors
Running inside
Anticipating your presence
Apprehension when at first I don't see you
Grace when you appear before mine eyes
Coming up behind you
Slowly
Not much of a surprise
Reaching up to hug you
Instead I place my hands on your shoulders
Leaning into your warmth
I decide to rest awhile
Still thinking about that hug
When you turn around and delight me with a smile and more warmth
Opening your arms for an embrace I gladly accept and appreciate
Now you're the one who's surprised me
Now you're the one I keep thinking about
