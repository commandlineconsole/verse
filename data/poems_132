MY OWN WAY OF DEFINING LOVE
when i love
i expect love to love
love,
without love loving love
what can love be?
stupidity,
foolishness, they all have
no place in me
when i love and i am not loved
i pack up and leave.
for love cannot be love
unless loved also in return
for love cannot grow
without love loving love
that cannot just love itself
