TEARS
my heart all but mutilated,
happiness strangled inside me, myself disconsolated,
the knot of depression tightens inside me,
suffocating in pain i cannot break free,
the blues brimmed in my heart gave a mournful sensation,
stricken with grief, i wearily suffered such emotions,
my happiness seared with pain and suffered,
i lost my conscience, inside me only sadness glimmered,
such emotions clinged and mutilated my joy and cheers,
for now i was left only with whimpers, sadness and tears
