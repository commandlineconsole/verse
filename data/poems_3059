SORROW
Sorrow came today,
And left me full of shame.
It's right down here inside of me
A feeling of disdain.
We cannot all defend ourselves,
As do the mighty foe,
Please rid me of this emptiness
Just let this sorrow go.
Here in the twilight hour
I feel like I could die;
When sorrow comes a rushing in
To send me to the sky.
