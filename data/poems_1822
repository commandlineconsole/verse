SURPRISE!
Surprises come without a word,
Keeping you guessing all the
time.
A surprise would never be a
surprise if you knew about it,
That is the secret of it all.
A can filled with artificial snakes,
Once opened a bundle of them come
popping out.
A jack in the box always surprises,
As you are waiting for something
to happen,
Suddenly, the jack in the box pops
out to say a big, 'Surprise! '
Sending chills down your spine,
When you jump to that unknown silly
surprise.
Like a friend or a family member sneaking
behind you,
When you don't expect it you suddenly hear
a, 'Surprise! '
A time when it is your birthday,
you arrive home and walk in the door,
Suddenly, you hear aloud, 'Surprise! '
Something you have always wanted
for a gift,
You open the gift with a happy surprise
deep within yourself.
Even when you won a million dollars,
you are speechless and you feel an excited
surprise.
Surprises are always different and are never
the same,
some are spooky and some are happy.
'What will your next surprise be? '
No one really never knows for sure?
One day you will surely have yourself
a big, 'Surprise! '
