SURPRISE
Around every corner is a surprise,
something new for our eyes
to gaze upon and marvel at.
We never know what it will be
or what shape it will take.
All we know for certain
as our lives progress
is that something will take us
wholly and utterly by surprise.
No one can predict if the surprise
will be good or bad.
All we know for certain
around each corner in life
there is a surprise.
