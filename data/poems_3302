CONCERN FOR PASSION
How high the Mount Everest is
Or how deep the Pacific is,
Is not my concern right now.
How much for me she cares
And how deep for me her love is,
Is my immediate concern.
How warm the sun is,
Or how cool the moon is,
Is not my anguish.
How warm her heart is,
And how cool her look is,
Is my desperate wish.
Concern for passion
Is corporal urge
That occupies foremost.
