I AM MOVED
”With humility I submit you are a great Poet”……. Vijaya Sarathi Putcha1
In what words I must acknowledge
The sentiments received in this age
They are not only heatening
But quiet encouraging
The poems are after all poems
It expresses concern to all of them
Someone may find it closer to their heart
It is all strength in pen that knits as an art
Person should remain down to earth
As no fame o wealth will be carried at the time of death
We are all human being and must take into consideration
The feelings, concern and above all good relation
I may have not that caliber
But it should act like weather
It must remain with each reason
Express anger, plight, pain and concern
I shall discharge all my functions
As an individual with no confusion
It is sacred duty of poet to remain in touch
And express freely in any circumstance as such
