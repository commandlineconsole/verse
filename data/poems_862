LOVE
Fulfilment of soul is love,
Finding its lost half
From endless counts of human kind;
It's pure joy, it's pure light
That lights soul, mind and heart
Together in a single glow;
It's recurring delightful flood
Of honey and sweet nectar
That enliven souls;
Love is awful surrender of souls
To each other
In selfless devotion,
Where joys swap
And beauty sprouts from each other;
Love is gentle divine lamp
That sheds light everlasting for both;
It blends to a flame
Inseparable ever
And fills them both in bliss forever.
Love is same glow in eyes of both,
Love is same beat in two hearts,
Love is same soul inhabiting two,
Love is same flow in two minds;
Love is shared joy, shared grief,
Love is shared courage, shared fear,
Love is shared dream, shared goal,
All glowing as one in single flame
And create enthralling single world
Of joy and beauty and contentment
That fills paradise in pathos and shame.
Joy and grief go hand in hand,
So love in essence is joy and grief;
Heavenly joy and hellhound grief
Dragging love on its own rails;
Nothing is anywhere like love's joy,
Nothing is anywhere like love's grief,
Both refurbishing soul to glittering gold;
Joy blossoms love and fills fragrance,
Grief deepens love and strengthens it
And enriched is love in joy and grief.
For two in love, nothing else matters,
For no world exists but each other for them;
Together they find all worlds they need,
And divine they are for each other;
He, her God, and she, his always,
Together they make a perfect world;
Though two they are for the visible world,
He in her and she in him, for them
Constitute advaita, the unity of twain.
