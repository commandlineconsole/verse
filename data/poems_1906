LIFE
Life
Life indeed is a full of surprises
You dont know what might happen next
Whether youre still standing and moving
Or forever be immobilized.
Do not expect too much in life
For we might be disappointed
When our expectation may not reach to each expected level
Just leave life the way it should be, no expectation and
most importantly be ready for all the surprises what life may bring you.
