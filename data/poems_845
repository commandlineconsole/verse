REALIZE THE TRUTH
When you are upset
From fighting with friends,
To crying about a low mark
Remember the times
When you were filled with joy.
The joy
Of finding your favorite board game
Wrapped as a present for you.
The joy
Of realizing you’re going
To Disney Land.
The joy
Of meeting your friends
After a month or two.
And realize the truth
For joy does not happen from luck
But from the way you see the world
Always try your best
To make your sorrows vanish
It’s not worth your time
To stay upset at all
Apologize and make up with your friends
Vow to work harder for school
For every thing in this world
Shall have a
Bright and Dark side
Your life’s happiness
Depends on you, controlled by you
By the way you see
By the way you react
If you want to live in joy,
Peace,
Happiness
Learn
To
Find
The
Bright
Side
Of
Life
