I CARE
What people dont care for
I care so much about
I care for everything wrong
I care for everything right
I care for my friends
I care for my enemies
I care for my peers
Even thought i dont have to
I care for the air
I care for abuse
I care for the Earth
I care about everything
See what others should care about?
I cant change the world alone
Thats why i need back up
To change the world forever
