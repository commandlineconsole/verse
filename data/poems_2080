LADY FROM THE SEA
Lady from the sea
perplexed, sexy
she was as surprised to see me
as I was, to see her in her nudity
Her breasts had the
warmth of the sea,
she let me touch;
and let my palms ride over
her curves and hips
her hair was wild
like the ocean in a rage
and what she hid
if she had let me in
could have drowned me
like an underwater cave could take
a drowning man, too drunk to know
Lady from the sea
perplexed, sexy
she was as surprised to see me
as I was to see her in her nudity
What did the lady from the sea
presided over by the moon
want from me?
I wanted her
She was bounty of the ocean
but it looked like she did not know her mind
and she slipped back into her beginnings
as if life underwater too
were but a dream
as it is for us humans on land
as we stumble from one day to the next;
and she sits there on the rocks
occasionally
looking at me
and slips back into the waters
if I turn to receive her breasts in my hands
Lady from the sea
perplexed, sexy
she was as surprised to see me
as I was to see her in her nudity
