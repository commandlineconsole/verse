INLOVE (POSITIVE-PARANOIA)
Yes you can call it madness
Paranoia if you wish
But love’s the sweetest malady
WE can’t afford to miss
Once afflicted
Everyone suffers the passions
Gets the jitters and cannot even sleep
It’s no wander it’s so hard to understand
This love stuff really deep
However
Within the torrid  passions
It’s the Only mental ailment
Nothing else can match
Everybody wants it
Though it’s very hard to find
Invisible to the ignorant
And missing to the blind
But hey I’ve got it badly
How lucky can that be
Positive-Paranoia
The way things aught to be
