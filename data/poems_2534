I'LL REMEMBER
I'll remember you
Your smile
Your laughter
And your brown eyes
Your smile was the most beautiful smile I've ever saw
It's hotter than fire
It's prettier than me
Your smile was a sun to me
You smile to welcome me
And to let me know that you loved me
Your smile was charming and calm
No matter how others' smiles are beautiful
As long as it's not yours, it's not special.
Your laughter was the most fantastic music I ever heard
The gentle melody with cheerful and soft harmony
I was glad I could listen to it everyday
Your laughter was a medicine to all the scars in my heart
When you laughed, I laughed
All the burdens, sadness, and angriness flowed away as I laughed
Your laughter was much more special than any other laughter.
I'll remember your brown eyes
Your brown eyes always looks into mine and says 3 wonderful words
I love you
I love to look at your eyes
I could see the reflection of me, only me
And it's so warm and sweet
Warmer and sweeter than drinking hot chocolate in winter
Your laughter always remain inside my heart forever.
I'll remember you
Your smile
Your laughter
And your brown eyes
No matter how pretty and beautiful other people's smile, laughter, and eyes are, if they're not yours than they're no special.
I want to thank you for everything
Thank you for always being there and my hero
And thank you for being with me and loving me
I'll remember you.
