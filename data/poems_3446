MIND AND ME ON FIRE
Trying to remember back when I had a passion
I thought I could change everything
Now I am sitting on a laptop staring at the screen
It used feel like it jumps outta my pits in my stomach
What happen to me? I don’t speak with the same mean.
Have I seen how I can’t change the way things is
I used to nourish my mind with my own sight
Now I listen to other dudes telling me to focus
Getting older feels overrated our fire seems to die
When the lights go out we close our eyes
Back in the day I would put on some headphones listen to my mind
Now I got to many concerns to wanna listen to me
Self medicate to quite our worried mind
I wanna hear my self that was more concerned with self enlightenment
