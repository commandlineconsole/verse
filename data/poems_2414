ANGER OR AGONY
One path is filled with anger,
Darkened with hate,
Swirling with spiteful desires.
The other is filled with pain,
Littered with sad memories,
Pulsing with the beating of a wounded heart.
If I must choose one path,
The choice would not be so clear,
For each one bears an abundance of dreadful surprises.
But is anger as dreadful as agony?
Are sad memories not more toxic than the feeling of hate?
Would spiteful desires not be easier to cope with than a wounded heart?
Anger clouds the mind, but pain cripples the soul,
Hate turns the heart cold, but sad memories tear it apart,
Spiteful desires fuel the fires of rage, but a wounded heart bleeds.
Who could be blamed, if forced with the choice,
Who would not take the lesser of two evils,
Who would rather wallow in grief and agony,
Than spiral in the painless storm that is anger?
