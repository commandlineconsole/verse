I FEAR FOR MYSELF
Wipe away my tears
but you'll never dispel my fears,
Read well my thoughts
but you'll never delet my doubts;
I fear not that a fig might run dry,
I fear not that I'll one day die,
I fear not that I might again cry,
I fear not that I might tear again my eye,
but, I fear for myself - for me:
that tommorrow you might love no longer...
And then leave me...
I fear for what I may be
if you, my love, sudden may cease to love me.
