SONNET # 357
It looks yes small when grown it is a good size.
But tell, it is big true as pleasure- increaser?
I thought and think the fun men aggrandize.
It`s not the big, but quality is better.
The eyes don`t come, though ours are greedy ones.
Eat with your eyes and later belly-hurting.
Keen pleasure had, but foolish eyes not fun
The meal goes well; your belly ends in dancing.
If fast you are and seeking pleasure wrong,
The quality comes short, never stays long.
It is not fine to look with eyes so strong
For true fun; feel to eyes does not belong.
So listen now, I say in every pleasure
The quantity the quality ne`er measures.
