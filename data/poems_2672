STUCK WITH SADNESS
I can't be happy
for i don't understand.
It's like a foreign island to me
a place i'd like to be
but can't.
Sadness is all i've ever known
it's the place i call home.
Someday, i hope it will be different
but for now i'm stuck
stuck in my sadness
stuck in my lies
stuck all alone
with sadness as my only friend.
