CONSIDER THIS
Make every day a special one
For younger you'll not be
Find joy in all the little things
And let your soul be free

Don't yearn for things you cannot have,
For that will spoil life's fun
If you can do this simple thing,
You'll be the lucky one.

For money cannot promise joy
But good health and love do
if you will just consider this
Then joy, will come to you.
