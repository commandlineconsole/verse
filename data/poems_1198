HELL IS WISE
Its true, hell is wise
For a soul that rise
From a grave to light
With a lot of delight
It sets a soul straight
It makes a soul cry
Until its eyes get dry
Will also make it fry
So soul will never try
To do the past crime
It gives lot of pain
That never goes in vain
Will always have a gain
That makes a soul shine
So hell is the main
Its a door of night
Its a path of fight
Winning soul is bright
If our eyes can sight
It makes a soul ignite
It sets a soul straight
With a lot of delight
From a gravy to light
For a soul that rise
Its true, hell is wise
