DESTINY'S WISDOM
....Once.......the winds
Of passion flowed
...Amongst the leaves
On vineyard's row
Touching the vines
With such desire
Fueling the flames
....Of a raging fire
*

*
Destiny's wisdom
....Then...rearranged
Those winds of passion
...To winds...of change
A frigid chill
Displaced the old
With angry gusts
....Of bitter cold
