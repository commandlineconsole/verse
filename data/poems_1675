THE GRIEF OF THE HEART
The grief of the heart
Is hard to measure
For pain that you feel
is like a pleasure
That only you
can feel inside
Which cover life's area
Both narrow and wide
So don't stop tears
If you feel bad
let it all out
And don't feel sad
And know in life
You have to face
All these things
With a trouble's trace
So don't try to measure
The grief of the heart
For its something to feel
Just like a pleasure.
