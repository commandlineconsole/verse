THE RED SKY
A red sky lights up the night,
Keeps your heart full of warmth,
Fills you with passion without greed,
This red sky at night,
Was just what you need.
A red sky lights up the morning,
With a beauty untold,
It wakes you from your sleep,
And heats up your soul,
This red sky in the morning,
Was a what made you whole.
This fiery passion inside,
It is much like these red skies,
Driving you from the warmest of days,
To the coldest of nights,
This fiery passion inside,
Never let it die.
