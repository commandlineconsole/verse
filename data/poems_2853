TO PRETEND
I pretend
To smile,
To laugh,
& show no sadness,
But nobody sees
How much I'm suffering.
I cry when no one is around.
I show my scars
When I'm proven down.
I go black & blue
To let everybody
Know what's true
From abundant of ppl
Who hides their feelings
Behind their laughter & smiles,
But what I do
Everyday of my life,
I pretend
To smile,
To laugh,
& show no sadness
