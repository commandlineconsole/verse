LET LOVE BE
I guess life is about feeling the love
Love, which we often tend to forget
Being in love with a feeling that love will prevail
By conquering all the odds
Love will prevail.
Others will forget the love which once was
Although, love has to go on
Without being suppressed
Since, when love is suppressed, then life becomes hell
Letting love go on by being in love
As the process of suffering is never ending
Similar, is the case with love
Letting love be, throughout your life
Even though, alone maybe our state
Love, let love be.
