SORROWS
As the falling rain,
prepares the earth, for the future crops,
Sorrows, showering on the heart
prepare and mellow it,
for the sowing of the seeds of wisdom,
perfecting the mind, and
gladdening the heart.
Clouds darken the earth,
but to cool and to fructify.
Grief like clouds,
shadow the heart,
to prepare it for nobler things.
Sorrow, the hour of reverence,
death knell blow to shallow sheer,
the ribald yest,
the cruel calumny.
Sorrows soften heart with sympathy,
enriching the mind with thoughtfulness,
the real collection of it,
being the fructification of mind,
when the sorrows pass away.
