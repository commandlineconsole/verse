I AM SEARCHING FOR MELODY IN LIFE
I am searching the melody of life
that will fill my heart
with all joys and tragedy of life
Thus, I am searching a melody
A melody that is not sung
by any one
which has definition of all
tragedy and joy of life
I am searching the melody of life
which has touched the highest peak of tragedy
to make me realise the highest peak of joy
to dive into the highest peak of happiness.
