A FOX'S DELIGHT
dancing by night and hunting by day,
we have heard the call,
the moon is our light,
the sun is our soul,
as all we have is each other,
we find our love,
and it is our delight,
as day falls to become the beautiful night,
we sing and dance to the sound of the drum,
as fire shines and water glistens,
we love this time for it is our joy,
as many of us are filled with delight.
