! ! ...DESIRE
(Inspired by Mr.Arkay Das's wonderful poem 'Desire')
My desire, in tandem with feral pleasure
Tidally rises, falls, and rises again
On mortal body bow, a pointed sin cursor
Soulless and weak, slips, fails again
On ice capped mount an austere pleasure
Mutates, revives and refines again
Lying on thorn bed, in penance posture
To crush his desire, by hammer of pain
A newborn desire of immature pleasure
Reaches fails and reaches again
From within the cradle, cosy and secure
It strives to touch and feel its domain
On crutches his desire, sans all pleasure
He limps and stops and limps again
Until the shadow of death in usher
Detached the bond of desire chain.
