~DEEP-R-DOWN~
How complete sorrow is...
Spilling over edges
onto mirrored floors, reflecting within.
Liking the view
You wallow,
Assured this won't be enough,
So you ready yourself
for the feathery cut
Back
up.

How complete sorrow is...
Spilling over edges,
within mirrored souls,
Reflecting within.
Liking the view
We wallow,
Assured this won't be enough,
As we ready ourselves
for the feathery cut
Back
up.
