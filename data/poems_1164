CHERRY PIE DELIGHT
Cherry pie delight
having after supper tonight.
Whip cream on top, so thick,
to make it, is quite a trick.
Filled with rich vanilla cream,
this sure does seem like a dream.
Cherries as big as can be,
from this table, I should try to flee.
With graham crackers crust
cleaning my plate, even if I bust.
Cherry pie delight,
knowing I'll be full tonight.
