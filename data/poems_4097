FEAR
Not knowing fear
I see your intent from afar
but distance offers me safety
I stand broad not knowing fear
I hear the strum of gut in the wind
I see your intent from afar
I stand broad not knowing fear
Chaos all around, sound drowned by bedlam
Men screaming in fear
I stand broad not knowing fear
I hear the whoosh
Vibrating the air around me
I stand broad not knowing fear
I see sun glint off your intent
That intent from afar
I stand broad not knowing fear
To late, I feel your intent
As your arrow pierces my heart
I stand broad not knowing fear
Thoughtless now, from your deadly spear
