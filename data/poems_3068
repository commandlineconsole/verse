SOMETHING LIKE THIS
somehow let your eye
lashes meet with my
lashes
let all your tears
adorn my eye lashes
you have stayed with me
thru all moments + times
yes, this body sometimes far
sometimes stays close
whatever sorrow you have
tell them about me
i do not like to see
this sorrow on your face
it does not not seen possible
to have a bond of sorrow
with you
listen to my request
remove that from your
face.
