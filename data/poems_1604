Nature is a core to human pleasure
Pleasure is a core to human nature
All humanity has an innate want or need for some piece, portion,
or association with nature
One's view of nature may differ from another but there is always
at least one association
To maintain and sustain the nature that provides that portion of
our needs and desires we must learn to not contend over the issues,
but to understand each others perspectives
No man can truly dispute or refute unless they have understanding
of both parties views
Nature should be a producer of peace and tranquillity not of dispute
and discontinuity
Breathe in the wonderful air that we have to enjoy and employ
A deep breath takes little time
Relieves a great deal of stress
Give us a boost of natural energy
And can keep the mind fed from catastrophe.
