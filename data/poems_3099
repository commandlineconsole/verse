OH, THIS BOOK
Oh, This Book
(Based on Dean Koontz 'book of counted sorrows')
Oh, this book of counted sorrows,
does it tell of our tomorrow's?
What do we know of this book?
Read it, take a second look.

Read of the terror in the night,
read of the terror in the light.
Read of the darkness within us all,
read of the evils big and small.

Fear the words and all they tell,
of dragon tears and mortar shell.
Feel the pain of all souls lost,
and how they all paid the cost.
Touch the book of counted sorrows,
and when you do, your soul it borrows.
It takes you into the world of terror,
brings you within reach of the devils lair.
Oh, this book of counted sorrows,
does it tell of our tomorrow's?
you must touch and read this book,
but, oh don't take that second look.
