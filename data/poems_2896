LIFE IN MY EYES
Sadness
Watching the many things that cannot be done for loved ones
Watching the man not say a word to the one he loves
Watching friends betraying one another
Watching the world fall apart
Sadness
Then hope
Like the one person who helps out others
Like the sunlight that peaks from under the cloud
Like seeing her happiness
Like the calm after the storm
Hope
Explanation: Its my first poem and I wrote it because I felt there was a need to put down my thoughts after all that has gone on in my life in the past year. Please comment.
