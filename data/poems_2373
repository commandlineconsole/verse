THE FEELING
A face of pain read like a map
Easy for some to read, Hard for others
Heart is a box of ice-cold hate
Hey thrown out, the box remains shut.
He should hate you
But you get all his thanks
Anger makes him stronger
Memories make his anger.
Starved of his pride
Will still stay a winner
Walks out proud
Hidden inside the fallen cloud.
Thunder his weapon
Rage his power
All his friends
Love his Anger
Pain
Hate
Love his enemy.
