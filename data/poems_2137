YOU FIND YOURSELF LOVED...
You find yourself loved
As seen by other eyes
It may be an acceptable surprise
A discovery of life
To be admired, an object of longing
Can be very tiresome
A criminal act, or worse –
Who needs to be loved that way
If that’s all there is?
And to be “appreciated”
As in the frame of some painting
With your soul in some gallery
With admission far from free
Is not to be respected
In what is worthy of respect
In what you consider vital
For the reasons you choose
May you find your self loving
In a flow unavoided
Lift the dam on a spirit
That is generous below
And by this, to discover
What is worth your acceptance
Surprised in the knowing
Growing precious and defined.
