WIND
Wind
Wind blow
Blow me far away
Away from my grief
Grief from loss
Loss of a brother
Brother younger than I
I have lost hold of my roots
Roots withering
Withering in salty tears
Tears drying on my face
Face of my brother in the mirror
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Wall of sadness
Sadness disappear with the wind
Wind
