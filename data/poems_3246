THE OTHER ART
There’s a side of you I fear I only see
In glimpses, shadows – peering through leaves
On an autumn tree
The bravado of knowing that loss will never hurt
Hides the fear and sorrow
Of the loss which follows us from birth
Life is a journey of picking up and letting go
But we carry with us the knowing
For it is in that knowing that all things grow
To cast aside with visage of uncaring futility
Hardens our hearts, our love, our soul
And in this I see great sorrow through any beauty
Rejoice in the winter’s barren sight
Carry its memory so that growth
May be bring you spring’s true delight
