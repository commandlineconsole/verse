THE TRAGICOMEDY
I do not get surprised
if a dumb sings in the paradise.
My surprise is how these politicians
sing under the hot sun?
I do not get surprised
if a blind sees in the heaven.
My surprise is how these hypocrites
see the poor people before the elections?
Alas! they crawl to the slums
and give promises to the cripples
that they can walk in the sky.
They act as deafs after the victory.
But we are the blind fools
who have daydreams of a dazzlement.
