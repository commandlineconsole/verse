DELIGHT
Life can be such A delight
If we don't argue and fight
The Lord said all will be alright
We are worthy in his sight
Our nights and days will be so bright
Like a lantern lights the night
Do the best with all your might
Your dreams will reach great height
Even feel like flying a kite
Everything will seem to go right
Your soul will take wings in flight
You will loosen somethig thats  tight
Unlock emotions with all your might
Life will be precious in your sight
Your life will be such a delight
