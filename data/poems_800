I'VE COME TO KNOW TO WELL
I've come to know
That with every joy
There comes a hurt
The hurt that the  joy
Will not last forever
So take that joy
Hold it tightly in your heart
Move it to your mind
Put it in some corner
Remember where it is
For there will be days
In your life
When things are so bad
You want to go sit
In the corner
To feel that joy again
