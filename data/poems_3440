KAL HO NA HO
The clock ticks and the times change
With this life alters its pulchritude
Live through the situations however strange
For the moment now may not be seen tomorrow.
Kal Ho Na Ho

The one who for you is concerned
Who is ever ready for a hand to lend
Such is the one who has real beauty
And an emblem of direction in your journey.

Strive to be with the concerned always
Cheer each other up throughout the days
Seek from God the distance from every sorrow
For the moment now may not be seen tomorrow.
Kal Ho Na Ho.

Go gaga in your love and adulation for Him
And your countenance with joy shall beam
Run for pardon for your grave flaws
Live through the situations whatever the laws
Kal Ho Na Ho.

Your life is a blending of ecstasy and bitterness
A blending of truth and deceptiveness
Set yourself apart from the group misled
Be with the righteous and remain level-headed
For the moment now may not be seen tomorrow
Kal Ho Na Ho.
