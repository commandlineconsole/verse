DAVID LETTERMAN/SARAH PALIN
Note-Just my thoughts on what some people might secretly think of this whole mess concerning Sarah *Crybaby* Palin and David Letterman.
Did't do not a thing wrong
All of us know that deep down
Vemon filled witch has no right to defend that immortal offspring of hers
In her blood deep runs a cold, cruel snake made just like her poisonous mama
Don't even try to deny who we all know you really are, little girl
Lady dragon for a mother who openly flaunted her lack of respect of American by letting you have that kid
Even if she were to someday, somehow worm her way into the White House I still would't respect her
The whole family should be avoided just like aids as far I'm concerned
The whole lot of you are a disgrace and an embrassment to this once fine nation
Either you people here with me or sad to say I think you're just like them
So what do you say?
Ramona Thompson, poet and genius of human nature has spoken
Do you stand with her or do you lay down with the dogs...err I mean...you know who
