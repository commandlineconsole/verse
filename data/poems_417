PASSION CRIMES
She the eye of da apple
the long eagle sigh
passion of my apples
the mammoth in summer
her passion is our crime
my love is da haters game
the stolen kiss i await
adult games i please
her lips are crime worthy
shes da queen in my castle
passion crimes
the crime we commits togethr
reosons we woke to steal
my breaths she stole away
heart of my hearts she hijacks
i steal death to be
next to you i shall be found
in ur arms wanna die
every poem shuold be for you
song praise her majesty
the passions of crime
