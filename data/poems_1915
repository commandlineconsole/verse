FINAL WORDS
I will remember your final words
Often spoken
Often unspoken
Often sweeter
Often bitter
But I will remember your final words;
More you delve
More I lose
More you pretend
More I surprise
Yet I must remember your final words;
I can   not suppress
The words can not be suppressed
Better I lose
Better you surprise
Better you live
Better I die
These are your final words
I am remembering now.
