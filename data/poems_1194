O THOU DIVINE
O The Spirit Absolute! O The Creator! O The Divine
Thou art the Supreme Bliss
Thou art the light inside the deepest cave in my heart
Thou art the spontaneous delight
Thou art the greatest Poet ever
The Creator of infinite delight
From time since Thou gave me life, light,  freedom
A freedom inside the golden bondage with Thy Love
That my soul plays in Thy Garden
