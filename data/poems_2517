I REMEMBER NOW...
These are about mamaseta
Gone with the love
Shes went away
To the anger
You took her away!
It's building inside
It's really stays the same
As you disapeard
I changed
Gone with the love
Haterid grew
Nothen left
Dead inside
Only anger remands
Wanna kill someone
Hurts someone
Their fault
I'm this way
Not giving just a little bit more
For her safety...
Shes gone
You put her there
She'll never come
Back to her home
All I wanna do is
Kill you both
Shes gone bc of you
You gave her pain
YOU FUCKING KILLED HER
For that I'll give you pain!
