BEFORE ADJOURNING
What is important?
Let me think…
Could it be learning?
Learning how to think…
How to be independent
Yet  concerning
Concerned about the future
How will it turn out
As the world is turning
How will things turn out
Because of you
Now… after… during
From first tying your shoe
‘Til the time you say adieu
Knowledge is a yearning
