THE MASK
I wish there was someone could see throu my mask.
My mask that holds so, so, so, many secrets.
Secrets that are about me and other people.
People that think it is weriod to show and kind of emotion.
Emotion that turns in to depression.
Depression that turns into anger.
Anger, hiding behing the small mask.
The small mask, that isn't big enough to hide all the
depression and anger.
Depression and anger that turns into your character.
Character that tunrs into who you are,
Which is how you act.
