A ROSE FELL DOWN
Touch my heart and arms
Look into the empty hands
Sorrows of dreadful dream
Have emptied my thoughts
A rose has fallen down
Scattered like blood stains
A heart fell down
The beauty lost its fancy
Touch my heart o friend
With love and affection
I can touch my heart with sorrow
With my empty hands
I can not find your love
Just give it to me
The rose you threw down
