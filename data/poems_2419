ANGRY ACHE
My anger rests tonight forming,
Of west and east the buds do grow,
I crazily ride from the aching.
This angle is abandoning,
My flowers are the bushes below,
My anger rests tonight forming.
How heaven waits for abhorring,
This land is home, the bread and dough,
I crazily ride from the aching.
This need is great then absorbing,
As medals awe me once fellow,
My anger rests tonight forming.
Then finally, wind aborting,
The land is praised embryo,
I crazily ride from the aching.
To see this birth so accessing,
I rode to winter to follow,
My anger rests tonight forming,
I crazily ride from the aching.
