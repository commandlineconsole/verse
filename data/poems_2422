NOT READY TO YELL
I have this friend of mine.
Who is obsessed with animé
Who can only express anger
When shugo chara is gay
So I decided to teach her.
What anger was about.
So that if Ikuto came back
She'd still know how to pout
But after failure and failure.
I couldn't get her to scream
Turns out anger
Is harder than it seems
'Ikuto sucks! '
I yelled to try and get her mad.
Which earned a proud glare
But left me feeling sad.
Anger wasn't her forté
So it clearly showed
why bother trying to change her
when her smile always glowed
There wasn't any point
To make her mad as hell.
When this rambunxious weird girl.
Was not quite ready to yell.
