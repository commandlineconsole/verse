CONFUSED
When we are born, we have no fear
Our fear list is quite bare
But as we grow and stub our toe
There are many things which scare
Our parents tell us don't touch the stove
It's very hot and'll burn you
Don't climb the tree, you'll skin your knee
Oh, you fell, well that'll learn you
Don't cross the road, don't touch that toad
There's danger at every turn
That snake'll bite with all its might
Oh when will you ever learn
Most fears we have will keep us safe
From being burnt and bitten and bruised
But sometimes fears can be all wrong
Sometimes they can get confused
An evil skull and crossbones
Is usually stuck on a poison jar
We learn to fear it, stay nowhere near it
To eat it would just be bizarre
But sometimes there can be a mix up
It has been known to occur
A poison's absence is the fear
A catastrophic way to err
A cigarette addict has this fear
Implanted deep within their brain
They struggle all of their life
This poison within them to maintain
It's quite hard work keeping the poison in
Because their body wants to expel it
They try their best, they cannot rest
If only they could farewell it
(Sydney, Australia - 2003)
