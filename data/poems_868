'MY JOY IS IN THE LORD'

My joy is in the Lord
If I’m waking or while I sleep.
I find His joy in everything
That joy I shall always seek to keep.
He fills my heart with a feeling of little bubbles
They’re bubbles of His Holy Spirit’s love.
My life I will give to only Him
For I seek His home above.
No other joy will man ever need
When you walk with Christ throughout your day.
Jesus was what the Father gave this world
He sent His Son who died, to save.
He walks amongst us guiding paths we walk
He shelters our spirit, from a blood stained cross.
Don’t let life ever take God’s joy away.
Walk with your Savior Jesus, walking with Him every day.
