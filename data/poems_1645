SPLENDID TREASURE
Sometimes I think and try to find
What brings pleasure to my mind
And what is that feels so nice
And makes me to do it twice
And then I think the best thing
That can to all joy bring
Is to say nice words of cheer
To make someone feel he's cared
And another thing is to do
Nice and good things dear too
And make others happy 'n smile
And spread care's joy around miles
And these things are splendid treasure
That gives to all joy and pleasure
And that's why its good 'n nice
To do them without thinking twice.
