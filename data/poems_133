WHAT IS LOVE?
Love is You
Love is Me
Love is an Appletree
Love is heaven
Love is hell
It's a mixture of good and bad
sometimes it makes you really sad
Love is fate
Love is made
Love is built
Love is forever
I know love is a feeling
i know love has no meaning
Love makes me happy
makes me cherish all that can be
Love is happy
Love is undescribable
Love is love
I love love.
