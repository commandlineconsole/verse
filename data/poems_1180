INTERPLANETARY EXPLORING DEVICE
and and we send a little car to explore mars
the aliens send a maze of well modulated nerves
to explore earth but with a central system
that can send messages to the the ends of universe
with the twinkle of an eye -  this instrument that
laughs, cries and dies to the aliens' exploratory delights
no doubt they have abandoned earth as it is ticking to an end
like how they have abandoned the pyramids all over earth
all these flesh and blood instruments that can cry, laugh,
and die to their creators' wonderful delights as they measure
every inch of mother earth with physical and biological accuracy
from far far away -  multifaceted instruments built to self destruct
