SURPRISES
People who still believe in good surprises are always young.
The ones who have come to believe surprises can only be bad,
or that there will no longer be any surprises at all are old- no matter
what their real age is.
The phone rings at night,
and the old ones think immediately of disaster:
An accident, illness, death.
The young ones simply think,
'I hope it's for me.'
of course there are bad surprises;
This is life after all, a grab bag.
But there are also the other kind.
They exist.
They do...
