VALLEY OF DEATH
Tears of sorrow poured profusely down their cheeks
Holy hymns were lost and dirges were heard for weeks
Peace escaped and hatred made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured down the cheeks of children
Who lost everything from a brother and even a parent
Playful life escaped worry made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured down the cheeks of daughters
Who lost everything from friends, brothers to fathers
Harmony escaped and the spirit of we made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured down the cheeks of mothers
Who lost everything from sons and husbands
Neighborhood escaped enmity made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured down the cheeks fathers
Who lost known brothers and friends
Brotherhood escaped vengeance made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured down the cheeks of brothers
Who lost everything from brothers to fathers
Friendship escaped and tribalism made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured the cheeks of parents
Who lost everything from sons to descendants
Trust escaped and doubt made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured down the cheeks of birds and wild
Who lost everything from variety of foods to place to build
Livelihood escaped and confusion made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured down the cheeks of life drums
Who lost everything to the sounds of bullets and guns
Life escaped and death made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured the cheeks of Baragoi
Which lost everything on that fateful day
Peace escaped war made its home
Forcibly in the valley for many to mourn
Tears of sorrow poured down the cheeks of Kenya
Which lost over forty two men in the valley of danger
Happiness escaped sorrow made its home
Forcibly in Kenya for Kenyans to mourn
