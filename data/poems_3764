HONESTY
Let's be brutal
Its stares you in the face
But no one seams to care
We say it
As often as we can
But no one seams to care
We open up
To say what we mean
But no one seams to care
So what's the point?
Of speaking up
If no one seams to care
But if you really mean it
And it comes straight from the heart
Then never give it up
Because at least you know you care
