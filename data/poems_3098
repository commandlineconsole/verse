THE JOURNEY OF LIFE
Drowning in the sea of sorrows
No way to survive
Trying to live for tomorrow
Am I really alive?
Suffering in the darkness
Light is no where to be seen
I have become so careless
When did people become so mean?
Iâ€™m on the road of life
Suffering in darkness and sorrow
The light comes in like a knife
Do I lead or do I follow?
All that I can see is Gray
In the middle of the journey
I am on the way
Can I see the reality?
Now that I am here
I have reached the end
Sorrow and darkness are always near
I am around the bend
The darkness and sorrow I can see no more
As I travel on
I have opened the door
And this is a new song.
