TEARS AND FEARS
Siege, siege, gripped by fears,
And the eyes are filled with tears
Though shadows drenched the tears;
Dawn has exposed those fears
Oh God shall allay the fears;
Lord, thou art that hears
My family shall hear my cheers
Though siege, siege, I am gripped by fears.
Siege, siege, my eyes are filled with tears
And no one seems to decipher those fears
