PAIN WITHIN
There is a pain within this heart,
My pain within my sadness through my eyes,
My eyes are like a burden that you can see right through me,
No pain I ever felt was that one single broken heart that had been left behind and never got a chance to be healed,
There is way out of this pain but somehow I canâ€™t see it,
See the light, the hope, the happiness I once wanted to feel,
Now I ever feel is this sadness, this pain, this heartache,
A pain within these wall I can hear it say,
There is no way out,
No way to wash away the pain,
The pain I feel.
