AVANT GARDE
i want to speak a woman language.
speak it, write it and think as if i am one.
it is an avant guard too?
-means 'advance guard' or 'vanguard'.[1] The adjective form is used in English, to refer to people or works that are experimental or innovative, particularly with respect to art, culture, and politics.-
i want to know why in front of a woman
like eileen
i could not say a shit.
what innovation is this?
why i need an avant, garde,
a body guard
or a security officer to secure
people's life
not mine?
language is not my concern.
a style is not my concern.
my concern is to move from eileen
'one'
to another hell eileen.
or do something that
makes sense to anybody
or event helps the quality of life for an ant.
i am still avant guard?
i left visual art.
it was not what i want.
it was one eye
and the other on eileen.
like a mysterious body guard.
i am still in the guard
avant
arriere
garde
en garde
marchant
en garde?
