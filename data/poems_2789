FEELINGS
These feelings inside
I try to hide
Of sadness, joy, hope and pride
I've lost my best friend
Or so I think
This whole month
Has been quite a stink
I swallow my pride I hide all my pain
If what they say is true
I have a lot to gain
I will try and I will strive
To live my life I must survive
When I feel sad, gloomy or mad
I think of the good times that we have had
These feelings inside I try to hide
Of sadness, hope, joy and pride
