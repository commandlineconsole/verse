LATE-NIGHT INTERRUPTION
Invisible tears stream inside me
In scalding alkaline trails
Melting my heart which was whole
Into a mutilated mass of clay
Weighing heavy in my core
Suddenly surrounding you is a wall
Of sarcasm, anger and insecurity
You wound with words
Benign at face value
Corrupted by tone.
The transparent wall
Reflects my words in elastic collision
Ringing hollowly like a leaden bell
My attempts at sharing you pervert into accusations
Your self-anger irrationalizing
The cold grey silence,
Stony flight
And projected blame
Leaving me steeped in metallic despair.
