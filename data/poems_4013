WHY DO YOU CARE
So what I am the way I am
Why do you care?
I am the way I am because I want to be this way
I act like I do because I want to
So what I am the way I am
Why do you care?
I am bi-sexual so what
What is the problem with that
Why do you care
I dye my hair black
I wear no dresses
I paint my finger nails dark
So what I am the way I am
Why do you care?
You judge me because
Of the way I am, I really don't care
Because no matter what
I will always be the way I am
So what I am the way I am
So why do you care?
