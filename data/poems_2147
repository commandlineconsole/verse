IF YOU BECOME MINE ('MEET THE MOMENTS')
Something is going around
Inside and outside everywhere
Love like sticky and bound
Giving its feelings and care
What you say is always nice
With everything or two
Touches that come like a surprise
Just for me and you
Let’s meet them halfway for more
Dream of their tune we can hear
Love is a wheel going for
Inside and outside quite near
Come with me darling to reap
Bring everything with you too
Yours and mine to keep
Everything thing is up to me and you
Love songs don’t ever come easy
They are so spellbound in a kiss
Feelings of breath quite breezy
That no one in love wants to miss
You are my darling and a fairy
I'll will someday buy you a ring
If you become mine quite dearly
I can to you this nice song sing
Chorus
Something is going around
Inside and outside everywhere
Love like sticky and bound
Giving its feelings and care
What you say is always nice
With everything or two
Touches that come like a surprise
Just for me and you
But everything turns here around
Grows from new to old
Other things always are found
You can’t to everything hold
Someday will be something new
That we didn’t plan somehow
Perhaps some acquaintances there too
That we don’t know about now…
Chorus
(Who said it was finished?)
