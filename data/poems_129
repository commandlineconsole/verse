LOVE ME SOON
Love me soon and love me now you are the only one for me
Love me soon and love me now your beauty enthrals my soul
Love me soon and love me now our hands intertwine as we begin to kiss
Love me soon and love me now my faith in you knows no bounds
Love me soon and love me now hold me close and kiss me dear
Love me soon and love me now kisses and cuddles await you in my loving arms
Love me soon and love me now my love for you is as beautiful as you are
Love me soon and love me now My heart is locked and youâ€™re the key
