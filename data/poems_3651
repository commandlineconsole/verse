THE MORNING AFTER MOSCOW
Loving friends to greet you
And send you into early morning revelry
Familiarity of things from milk to chocolate
And the greetings of the dog and cats
In ways a Grande Salon
Does not accomodate.
But of all the things that struck
In coming back
The most surpiring thing
Concerned a hat.
A hat far too heavy for South Texas wear
Though a wonder for the snows of Moscow
Where not a lick of notice did it once receive
But - 15 is not 54
Though shock of travel did not call its name.
