FEELINGS
If this is the feeling of hatred
I wish it would never be known
Because it cause so much blood
And so many deaths
If this is the feeling of sadness
I wish it would go away
Sadness takes so many tears
If this the feeling of love
I wish it would stay forever
I feel so warm within
If this is the feeling of happiness
I wish I could keep it
Because I truly want to be happy
So many feelings, so little time to express them
