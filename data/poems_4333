FEAR NOT THE UNKNOWN FACE OF FEAR
You cant predict what you'll be afraid of  next,
just hope with time the fear will fade.
I look back at all
that frightened me
as child and laugh.
Before cancer, organ failure,
global takeover or sudden car crash,
there were ufos, bolts of lightning,
Spielberg's E.T.  and
thoughts of my parents divorcing,
peewee herman made me cry
as did the thought of my father
being deployed to fight in a foreign war.
There were the unknowns waiting in my closet,
the shadows lurking outside my window.
Thought of scorpions and blackwidows,
stinging and biting,
as I went to put on my shoes.
Then came the fear
of not being accepted as cool;
what brand is my shirt,
what brand are your shoes?
Fear to speak
afraid of judgment
afraid of asking for help
afraid of my own scary self
the fear of  mirror reflection
afraid of peer rejection
fear of the snickers
afraid of the whispers
afraid of opinion
fear of the truth
fear of goodbyes
afraid of hellos
fear of the dark
afraid of the bed
fear of my own frightful head
wosrt of all the fears
the fear surrounding the dead
No fear now in the comforting voice,
assuring the fear is all inside my head.
