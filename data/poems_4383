KNOWLEDGE IS MOTHER OF LIFE DIVINE!
Only of evils in own,
seeing the path of Goodness and Godliness,
Knowledge is not mother of fear,
But knowledge is mother of Care,
Against one's own fall or care about fall of  others!
Knowledge is not mother of fear,
Knowledge is the spear,
Knowledge is spear that kills the fear,
And takes to fearless sphere!
`FEAR Is Mother Of
KNOWLEDGE.
Aye or Nay, you decide!
How can one born to fear can dare,
how can one see is own nature,
fear, if governs his mind and thought,
How one fear more,
Can open windows and door?
Fear is not the mother of love,
A child's love to its mother or father,
Is just Love And Respect,
Not fear the mother of all these,
Fear only maketh one run away from Father,
Love And affection take near to Him!
Knowledge is mother of Courage,
Love, faith, belief and aspiration of oneness!
Fear is mother of Cowardice, doubts, hate,
Fear is mother of all slips and fall,
Fear is the mother of ill fate!
Only Love, The love of truth, and love with True knowledge is the mother of Life Divine!
Aye or Nay you Decide!
