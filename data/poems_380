PASSION
The heights of passion
Heighten the heights of action
Deepening the height of destruction
And destructing the actions of construction
Subtraction is not an option of action
Friction might in passion be fiction
Oh passionate passion for a person
How do you impersonate with irritation?
An action that's outta fashion
Like bungalow outdone by mansion
You see not the scenes of sin
As a scene you see that make sin
How then is passion of a person,
supposedly causing him destruction?
That flames ignited consume a fraction,
Of actions with poor contraction
The furnace is ooh so in construction
That all within is by coercion
For wealth and riches are a situation
But passionate passion is a person
cold and hot, never faces reduction
Always in action headed for production
For passion, it's not about mass action
Inasmuch as there's a match in tension
Tense tension that's never past tense
A present that is continuous tense
But the one that fathoms its essence,
None other can decipher its presence
What is power without any passion?
Whatever zeal is if passion is outta action?
Whoever prominence makes to sense,
Wherever eminence is in essence
Who quenches the unquenchable passion?
What action cautions the act in passion?
Show me what overwhelms the overwhelmed
Tell me who is in the helm of the dead?
The dead that death has on laid a wreath?
What is death if passion takes no wrath
Who is life if in passion there's strife
Strive in strife has become contention
But passion in strife there's still a connection
Oh passion! Passion! Make me a person
Of action, passion and assertion
