LOOK AT ME IN THY EYES
LOOK AT ME IN THY EYE
melvin Banggollay
Look at me in my eyes
and you'll see, you're inside
the chamber of my cries
with a love never subside.
My eyes never disguise
What's deep here inside
for what gives me delight
is only you're cheerful sight
Keep me in your eyes
to mirror my love's light
for only you in my life
can let my eyes see delight.
