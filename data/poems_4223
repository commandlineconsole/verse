FAITH
You fear sorrow
You fear hate
You fear life only breaks
But do you fear me to leave me…
My fear is losing you.
My fear breaks me in two.
For you to leave me still
A heart that’s not yet healed.
All you know is fear.
But what of faith?
You silently look away
You silently break today.
Your tears bring me to cry.
For you fear you’ll lose me
But what of life with me?
Fear not, for I will come back.

I am always here
Nor wind Nor fright
Can leave me here tonight.
After seeing you
I know a lot about faith.
