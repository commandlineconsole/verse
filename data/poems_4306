FEAR
Do you know the definition of fear?
The fear of not knowing
Hoping to always persevere.
Don’t you wish fear could be understood crystal-clear?
You want to let go, but you must resist the temptation of just flowing.
Do you know the definition of fear?
Some taken by fear wish for their very own musketeer.
Always wishing for that light, always hoping.
Hoping to always persevere.
Fear, almost like being taken by a spear,
But still knowing and hoping.
Do you know the definition of fear?
Don’t you wish you could be a general and command a cavalier.
You say charge and your cavalier continues, never slowing.
Do you know the definition of fear?
Hoping to always persevere.
