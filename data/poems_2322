SEVEN DAYS
Seven days of anger
Seven days of fear
Seven days of pain
Seven days of misery
They tell me I am here,
But I am not.
They tell me I am a good person,
But yet I feel like I am a jerk.
Seven days I couldn't die
I couldn't die from anger
I couldn't die from fear
I couldn't die from pain
I couldn't die from misery
On the seventh day
I discover that,
all my anger, all my fears,
all my pain, all my misery
alll of it,
is just a dream.
