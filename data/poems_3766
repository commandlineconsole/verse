BLEEDING HEART
Who cares for the life,
If the pain pins you?
Who cares for the future
If the pain is so sure?
Who cares for a friend
If the untruth is the trend?
Who cares for you
If infidelity is a due?
What is left is a bleeding heart,
None cares but a scar left behind,
Time heals but takes so long,
A knife will cure no longer.
