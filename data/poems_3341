THE AMATEUR POET
Here I am writing trying to be a poet
Writing as an outlet, a freedom to my spirit
this life in the Dullsville can be good
as it can get out the writer in you
Not so concern about grammar
as some books were not written in a good manner
maybe years later a kind person just proofread it
edit and make it more easier and good to read
it's the thought that counts
as they say,
it's the soul expressed in words
write your dreams, concerns or anything
write your anxieties and it will lighten up your feeling
