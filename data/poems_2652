SWEET, SWEET SADNESS
Whenever the little girl smiled there were tears in her eyes
whenever the little girl hugged you she was saying goodbye
whenever the little girl sang you can hear her crying
in sweet, sweet sadness.
The little girl died some time ago
people listen to her songs and hear her ghost
it's crying, but it's also smiling
in sweet, sweet sadness.
Oh, the little girl died before she broke
she asked me to write out her poems
some of them are sad and some of them are sweet
when I read them I always cry
in sweet, sweet sadness
I knew this little girl.
