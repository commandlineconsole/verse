DANCING WITH SORROW
Amidst a garden in a twist of fate
I dance with Sorrow in an evening late
We hold our hands and tend our steps in pace
Then glide like silk with songs of Tears in grace
And Sorrow knows just how to blend us fair
Her dance entwines with mine we float in air
While Tears had weaved us songs in hurtful bends
We drift with her and now we're three of friends
With Tears I sing and soothe the night away
And Sorrow lures my eyes to dance and stay
In trance with Sorrow's hand I dance along
And spend the night with Tear's lingering song
So soon we part and each should go his way
with trust in hearts to meet by fate someday
