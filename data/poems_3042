AN ODE ON SORROW
My dear sorrow
love me true and deep
Touch my heart with passion intense
and keep me forever in your loving gaze
Stride by my side sorrow
hand in hand, never to part
Let my days be filled with thy remembrance
and let my nights pass in your caring embrace
For in you​r ​loving ​countenance there's​ constancy ​
and true are you in your ardour
I​n ​yo​ur presence there's joy, deep ​
t​hat fills the heart and moves the soul
And what would life be without your ​companionship,
for u sorrow, are my joy!
