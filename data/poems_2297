LEAST SAID SOONEST MENDED.
Least said soonest mended.
In the anger of the moment.
We react instinctively
Harsh words spill out by accident
Which we regret immediately.
Anger looses inhibitions
We do not think before we speak.
The spoken word can’t be unsaid
However much we may regret.
Although our anger’s long since fled
Those we offend do not forget.
Anger loosens inhibitions.
We do not think before we speak.
Old friends become new enemies.
Misunderstandings on both sides
Exchanging apologies
may help but bitterness abides.
Anger loosens inhibitions
We do not think before we speak.
Reacting to a perceived slight.
Something we are prone to do.
We forget to be polite.
It’s unfortunate but it’s true.
