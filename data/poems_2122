SPIRAL
the lights are dim and your
closing the door because
the hallway lights are too bright.
take me home,
i don't belong here,
you said.
my utensils are
all out of workable led.
you told me to follow
you to my bed,
and you ripped off my clothes,
i lost my my head
somewhere in a mess of thoughts
above me, dying to be fed.
i snapped out of my daydream
and I thought i was dead,
but you just stole something
i was trying to regain again.
surprise, surprise,
you didn't even bother to
clean up your mess.
