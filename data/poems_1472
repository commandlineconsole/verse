SATIETY
Fatigued..
This moment..
Golden jubilee carrying on to Diamond
Wheeling, rolling pain, pleasure, pain, pleasure
Yes
Treasured life measured of pain and pleasure
Fatigued
Uncertainty? yes
Bloody plexus, pain-pleasure nexus
Sixtyplus terrified
White and black, bright and dark..
Yes
God is fair, unfair
Enough, enough
Yet just one wish
Just enough to retire eternal
Only in fair God
