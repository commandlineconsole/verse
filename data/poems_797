RIVER OF JOY
Flowing with the river of joy
I met you here in the beginning
In the middle and also in the end
Of my life O my dear
I am feeling You are moving
In me also in joy
And I am doing nothing
You are doing everything
For me in love
I know You are my infinite
Source of joy O my dear
I am pondering and getting
Joy out of You in me.
