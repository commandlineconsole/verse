A MOMENT OF LIBERATION
Let not the outside

Distract you
No more

Rather

Feel that joy within

Which bubbles up

From an undefined

Source

Bubbles up naturally

As a spring from

Deep within the Earth

Yet

This joy is not just of this Earth

But

A joy

That comes from a place
Deep within yourself

A place unguarded

Fully accessable

The watchman has left

Due to the billance

Of a Light

Now

The cells of the human body

Sing with joy

The heart awakens

And

Is enlivened

Peace is at hand

And

A lion speaks

To a lamb

Angels speak to one another

As the Earth responds

A chorus begins

A song sung in the freedom

Of

A moment of liberation

Unite

A union is formed

Hearts sing out

A song of Love

Heaven and Earth respond

And Peace

Prevails for this moment

As joy returns

As God and Man

Unite

And

Be as one

In
Love.
