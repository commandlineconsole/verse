THE SEA HAS A MOUTH
in my study
today i am given the rules
concerning the
mouth of the sea
how it sends the waves
like tongues
to deposit some corals on the shore
which to my imagination
has become the lap of my lustful
creation
on the other hand the two rivers nearby
meet the sea
and too give their gifts of soil, sand and
silt
all offerings to finally
create an island
that all the parties now
dispute
as exclusively owned
by either
never neither
sometimes it is Mother
Nature that creates the problem
and people die.
