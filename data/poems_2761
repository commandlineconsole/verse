INJUSTICE
Sadness in sadness
Faces to faces
I lose my reality
From high to no sanity
Why did I think that things would succeed?
When all I ever did live and elude
Was it self consolation?
Or pity as a whole
How can I move on when my heart won’t let go
How can I move on when my mind tells me no
My future I can’t decide
Factors critical
I stole and I lied fatal musical
I live and I leave
I die and I dye
Gone is my want.    For money comes and now I have none
I breathe with a feeling of lost
Goodbye my wishes, goodbye my love
For lost is my dove
