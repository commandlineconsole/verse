CHIVALRY
Since marriage ends upon the Earth
Let friendship then but show it's worth
with Chivalry that knightly play
And wander  in the light of  day
like Guinevere and Lancelot
Upon the fields of Camelot
Let night encroach with passions fire
Chaste love will heighten our desire
and quench all lust to manifest
our soul’s communion in that nest
where passion is the slave of love
In charity like Christ above
And if the night could set us free
One kiss of innocence will be
A seal upon thy passion’s flower
A diadem within thy dower
