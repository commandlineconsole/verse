DO YOU
Do you care, truly care
Do you see, see what she is going through
Do you hear, hear what she says
Do you know, know she crys every night
Do you care, care that she carved her name in her leg
Do you see, see what she is asking for
Do you see, see how sad she is
Do you realy care for her at all
