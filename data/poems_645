FORGET ME NOT
Forget me not-
Beauty of the night
For your flaming passions of
Fire and Air
Crystal and water
Drip through the crevices
Of my stony heart
Breaking it asunder
And releasing
Contrary emotions
Of love and hate -
Passion and desire.
I release the yellow
Pigeons to fly
To the Secret Island of Aslos
There your hand will bring
Down the dove, now transformed
From pigeons to that.
Oh, beauty, I sing
Songs about you
To anyone who'll listen
In hopes that one day
That it'll be repeated
To you, oh- how still
Your heart and hand lies
I hope the song
Will quicken
These and you will
Return for
Me.
