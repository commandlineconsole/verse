'FORGIVE AND FORGET'
Once I found myself angered and frustrated,
I called it my 'Hall of Shame, '
Jotting down their licence number,
Saw each number so clear and plain.
I was going to call the athorities,
Report what they had done,
But set it aside, alone with my anger,
All my anger whiched weighed on me a ton.
I could never fully understand as time had passed,
The importance of the numbers I'd jotted down,
My 'sin no more' as in (1 Cor.13-5) ,
'Love keeps no record of wrongs.'
