EMOTIONAL INDUCTION
With emotional induction
Started bio-chemical reaction
Driving slow and deep
In the ocean of pleasure
You rest with me in sleep
The moments of fun and pleasure
Drinking wine and climbing alpine
You face glows and does shine
Starting in a mood of inaction
You turned me in rapid action
Burning the fire of desire
Ready to attack, no ceasefire
Enjoying whole night
Full of pleasure and delight
