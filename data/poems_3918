KILL ME
I can't take it anymore
I shouldn't even want this
I have a mind that works on its own
It wants me gone
Not many care about me
And the one that I care most about
Seems as if she doesn't care anymore
She could care less than others
My head is torturing me everyday
With all my memories of her
My imagination is taking over
Making me want her back more
I see her with someone
I read her poems
I see all of it in my head
I can't take it
So please just kill me..: (
