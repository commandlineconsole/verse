FEAR
I fear so many things,
Even though I should fear only fear itself.
I fear the stab of betrayal,
Lost in the fear of loving again.
I fear the future,
Especially among past decisions that strike fear to my heart.
I fear the enclosing darkness,
After the fear of light forever fading.
I fear the slice of revenge,
Among the many fears of being a forgotten discard.
I fear the sound of a clock passing time,
Silently hidden in the fear of time passing too slowly.
I fear the pull of hunger,
Between the days of fear of gaining the weight.
I fear so many things,
Yet fear is something I canâ€™t seem to fear.
