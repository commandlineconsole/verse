LOVE IS
Love is hot like the Arizona desert
Love is strange not depending on the weather
Love is pure as that very first day
Love is many things when you make it that way
Love is sweet like no fruit known
Love is cutting like a rose bush thorn
Love is complicated like April the 15th
Love is suffocating when it doesn’t fit your needs
Love is a disease when your love is gone
Love isn’t like losing everything you own
Love is a fire with a volcano’s burn
Love is a precious thing like a new born baby
in her mother’s arms
Love Love Love
Love is needed, love is giving
Love is wanted, love is silly
Love is desirable, love is killing
Love is peace, and understanding
Remember when your parents would scold you
You went to your grandma she would hold you
As she explained the way of life to you
That was   l o v e
Love is painful, sometimes
Love is a snake tempting your fate
Love is in the air on your first date
Love is a hyena laughing at you
Love is friendship your whole life through
Love is marriage love is missing
Love is the word you never said
Love is delicate
Now it’s too late your love is gone
What’s wrong with you man
Love is beautiful
Love is life
