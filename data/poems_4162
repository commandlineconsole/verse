FEAR.....
do you fear
when you see the truth
do you fear
when you speak
what is true
do you fear
when they call you
paranoid
do you fear
when you're pushed aside
do you fear
you might get ostracized
do you fear
when characterized
as evil, and told
you won't get any paradise
It's all about keeping you down in fear
and not letting you face it in clear
pushing you down,
down in fear
take charge but don't act Cavalier
stay honest and be a pioneer
life is such a (b***h)
and seems always unclear
but it's not true what and how it appears
let’s adhere
to truth and persevere
keep fighting
and you won't disappear
in the dark and gloomy frontier
just fight those fears
fight your fears
don't let them come near
and you will have a happy and prosperous
New Yea﻿ r! !
