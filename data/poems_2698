STAR CHILD
Joy alloyed with sadness,
And sadness alloyed with joy.
Filled the hearts of witness
To the birth of this unique boy.
For he possessed a unique genius,
The very soul of God himself.
Who knows the beginnings of this genus,
That resides unborn within all else.
For lightning paled in comparison,
To the light of glory he embrace.
It was the light to open dark's prison,
To  lead us to a freer place.
But his enemies will grow with anger,
For it is not all men he could save.
And his course would be laden with danger,
His fate crucified and the grave.
Still joy alloyed with sadness,
and Sadness  alloyed with joy.
Fill the hearts of witness,
To the death of this unique boy.
