PARTS AND TIME
Been caught deep within the confines of my self-created hell
I cannot feel a god damn thing, and it's so hard for me to tell
What is it in this world that's important? What should I be fighting for?
I cannot figure out what I am, and sure can't remember what I was before.
'Cause all I know is what time it is
Everything else just ain't my concern
All I know is that I exist
Everything else just ain't part of my world
As I lay here awake in bed I let my horrid thoughts overtake me
Ones of loneliness and worthlessness, courtesy of my low self-esteem
I can feel my tears starting to well up, though they never seem to fall
Until I finally reach my breaking point and I just can't take it all
'Cause all I know is what time it is
Everything else just ain't my concern
All I know is that I exist
Everything else just ain't part of my world
As I lay here awake again my thoughts come and overtake me
But they're not so horrid this time around; I think of you and drift to sleep
I dream of you so warmly, and curse the time when I finally awake
And everyday being so close to you just makes my body shake
'Cause all I know is that I'm in love
Everything else just ain't my concern
All I know is that this is tough
But it's time to make you a part of my world
