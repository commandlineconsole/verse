FEAR
I see the world is beautiful
I see the world is full of love
But not the creatures that live in it
I see the world doesn’t get old
Only creatures that live in it
I see the world does not end
I see the world does not envy
Only the creatures that live in it
I see the world so beautiful
I have played my part too
I have had a chance to share in the beauty
Yet I fear
I fear the cruelty in the world
I fear the cold hearts
I fear the thoughtless minds
As great as is I in my home
As protective as I am
As trusting as I am to HIM
Still I fear
I fear the human animals
I fear the human vultures
I fear the human monsters
When the doctor said “its a girl”
I cried
I cried tears of fear
I cried tears of fear
I fear it, it that rapes the little ones
I don’t know what it is
I think it’s a monster
I think it’s a virus
I don’t know if we inherited it in my blood flow
I don’t know if we infected in my blood flow
Yet I fear
I fear for my little girl
I fear for my little boy
I fear for my babies
I fear to have more babies
A blessing given by the Almighty
“A make believe” makes us think it’s a curse
A curse
Does that mean being human is a curse
Does that mean I’m a curse
Does that mean you’re a curse
Does that mean we a curse
If not why allow him to play us
Why allow him make us curse each love
GOD is LOVE lets love and embrace our children
STOP CHILD ABUSE
STOP WOMEN ABUSE
STOP ABUSE
STOP RAPE
