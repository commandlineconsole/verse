SADNESS AND LOSS/ COME AGAIN AND AGAIN
SADNESS AND LOSS/ COME AGAIN AND AGAIN
Sadness and loss
Come again and again
In old age-
Friends all hurt
In various ways.
There is no answer
It will never be
Completely alright again,
As one once dreamed
It could be.
Life is difficult
And will be more difficult.,
But so long as it is still life
We must try to find in it
some love and some happiness.
