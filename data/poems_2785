TO HAVE AND TO HOLD
To have and to hold
Will never be me
Not her no-one else
This sadness I see
Although sadness grips
And loneliness cold
To have and to hold
Is not me I'm told
To have and to hold
A hope that's no more
A dream dreamt no more
of what was in store
To have and to hold
To laugh or to cry
Will never be me
No more dont know why
