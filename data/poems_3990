WHY CARE
i wait for the moment
the moment of change
im alone waiting for someone
to take me away from the pain
it might not be soon
but the day will come
and when it does
ill forget about you
like you forgot me
i see you every day
but still no word
i wait and wait
just for you to say hi
but still no word
so why
why do you treat me so badly
did i do something to you
or is it that you just dont care
i see you with everyone
but me
it makes me sad
and it makes me mad
until someone comes
someone who cares
ill be here convincing myself
you do care
but deep down
i know you dont
no matter how hard
i try
you still dont care
so it must be me
im the problem
so when im gone
you'll be happy
dont worry, have no fear
ill be gone, away from here
you'll never know im gone
you'll never have to worry
what happened to her
but as if you would
care about me
as much as i care for you
