I CARE NOT THE SUN
I care and I care
That I am here.
The sun is black
At this hour
Here no water
In this river
In this ocean.
I care not the sun
And I care not the air
I care and I care.
The moon is with me
All day all night
And I asked it
In this manner
With a corn.
And I care the sun
That is over my head
And have a fun.
