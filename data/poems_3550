ALIEN CONCERN
Alien Concern
by Ted L Glines
We saw an alien ship above us high,
it came so fast and then it streaked away,
we couldn't hope to catch it now today,
our watchers always scan the nighttime sky,
in hopes to catch a saucer passing by,
but never do the aliens pause or stay,
someday, we'll talk to them - what will we say,
we hope the day will come before we die.
And in the news a girl-scout teacher plays
for she enslaved a frightened teenage boy,
and CEOs are begging for our cash,
while methamphetamines bring needed joy,
and crimes are running rampant - no one pays
as people morph their lives to insane trash.
The aliens needed somewhere for their foes,
a planet holding those with mental woes,
they sought a mad-house base
until they found the proper place,
and now I know for sure which one they chose.
