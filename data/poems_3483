ISOSCELES; YOU'RE THE SHORT SIDE
I've been at your friend's house.
You're right, but why should
That mean much to you?  We
Are not lovers anymore.  You
May remember telling me
To go, and saying what I did
Would be of no concern
To you, so, why, now, suddenly,
Concern?  You're worried I
Will hurt your friend?  She's
All grown up.  She'll be okay,
And, anyway, she asked me over.
You look shocked.  You didn't
Know?  Well, I suppose she
Took you at your word when
You said we were finished,
Saw her chance, and saw no
Point to telling you she
Planned to bring me home.
