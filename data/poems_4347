GOD LOVING
I know there are two kingdoms
Kingdom of Lord and kingdom of ours
Our kingdom is again divided
Kingdom of men and kingdom of women
Each again divided
Thought kingdom of evil and good
Whereas Kingdom of Heaven
Measured and balanced
Ours;  unmeasured, un-balanced
So unjust, learnt not to adjust.
We are harmed more
By our own thought and attitude
Than the Lord
Unquenchable desire and greed
We are not free and never will be freed
The doggy- dogmaâ€™s of our faith
Caste, creed, race and  colour
We habitat in war parlour
Perhaps to un-beautify the beauty
Beauty of the humanity with artificiality
We learnt to fear and freedom we lost
We all are false  God fearing people
If so we would not feared
Fearing one, we learnt not to fear, many
Still we fear, so we are not God fearing
Now the truth felt and thought I
I will to be  a God Loving
Praise must be to Him
And to His Kingdom only
Destroying my filthy dirty thought kingdom
