GREATEST SATISFACTION
Life gives us many opportunities to live
Happily if we can learn to live
Others happiness that they deserve
With tons of care, joy and love
And when we give all these things
To others then the joy it brings
Give us greatest satisfaction of all
In every deed of kindness big or small
So to gain joy what we must do
Is to give happiness to others too
And give others the joy they deserve
With the gift of tons of care and love.
