LOVE IS JUST A FOUR LETTER WORD
love is just a four letter word
no one knows what love is
you can argue all yo want about being in love
even grown ups dont know what love is
love sucks
love hates
love breaks
love is just a four letter word
love waits, and love does not pressure
love is just a word
is love even real
how would you know
love is all you hear about
i love her, i love him
NO YOU DONT
love is kind
love is a feeling
how do u know when someone really loves you
love is just a four letter word
