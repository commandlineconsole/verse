BEAUTIFUL FROZEN NIGHT
Stars shining
Golden white
Through the cold and frozen night
Trees laden
Bearing ice
Radiant in the golden  night
Ah a delight
Stick like shadows
Heads bowed low
Slipping and slithering across
The pristine ground below
Lights flickering golden white
In the beautiful frozen night
Ah a delight.
