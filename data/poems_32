FOR EVER LOVE
Love love and love love, for ever love
Love is here, love is there, for ever love
Love is life, life is love, love-life, life-love
Let us love, without love we are scattered, my dear
Love love and love love, You are my love
Here in love I give everything
There in love you give everything
There is nothing besides love, and love and love.
