~~~! ANGER WITHIN! ~~~
The anger within me lays dangerously dormant,
But part of it still burns, a small remnant.
It slowly brews up within
Then unleashed with no care for making sin.
It rages on like a raging torrent,
Gushing out frustration and hate like water from a hydrant
Anger is like an enraged beast
When released it isn't easily ceased.
Don't vent anger if you don't wanna go to hell,
Don't vent anger if you wanna go to a prison cell.
Don't play with anger, I say,
Don't let anger ruin your day!
