MY CANADIAN CHRONICLES 32
On my holiday, I have had many surprises,
but none like I had on my birthday.
'The Auburn' is a prestigious place
where poets go in Calgary.
I had the honour of taking the open mike
and reading a couple of my poems to them.
However, what happen next took me by surprise.
When I had finished and left the stage
the poets at 'The Auburn' sang happy birthday to me,
then my friend Melvina read out a birthday poem
she had written especially for me.
It didnâ€™t end there,
for during the interval they brought out my cake.
My two friends Sue and Melvina
kept the whole thing from me,
but what a wonderful surprise.
The whole evening was too wonderful for words
and something I will never forget
and yet another thing I have to thank
my two adopted sisters for.
