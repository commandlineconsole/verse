A NIGHT OF DELIGHT
As I sit here thinking of last night
it fills my heart with delight
the way you looked at me filled my body with glee
you held me so close with a warm embrace
it was then I realized just how nice it was to feel so free, the way I felt when you embraced me
The kiss you gave me was a delight
it made me feel so very  bright
the night went by so  fast
I sure did have a blast
The way you looked at me with your eyes
made me wanna cry
I knew the night was about to end
for me I was ready to descend
The time has come for that last embrace
I knew it was a night I didnâ€™t want to erase
You made me feel like a queen
a queen for the night was just a delight
