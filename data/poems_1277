IN THE CAR, TO THE TUNE OF 'I FEEL PRETTY'
I feel ready
and delighted
to start off the day with such zest
and sustain it
knowing well
I’ll give my very best.
I feel productive
and eager
to use the resources required
and indeed I
can’t wait for the results desired.
I am planning
the fine details
of my schedule and strategies for today
so I’m not bothered
with red robots along the way.
And at sunset
I am positive
I’ll review the past day with delight
and satisfaction
when I close my sleepy eyes tonight.
