CUTTING
Setting here think about you
Sitting here watching you die
Feeling nothing but sadness
A knife calling my name
Hoping it’ll be going in my vanes
Deeper and deeper it go’s
Soon I’ll forget my own name
the blood run down my arms
Telling me it’s ok for you to go
Hoping you’ll be alright when I die next to you
Feeling nothing but sadness watching you go
I feel that I need to go to
So wheat for me I’ll die with you
Let’s hope the after life is better than this one
