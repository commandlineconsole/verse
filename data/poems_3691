SHOULD I
Sometimes we wonder
why must we care for others
do others care for us?
failing in our thoughts
and ailing in our feelings
we neglect the reality,
while we care for others
we selfishly caring for us too;
don’t we care for others with love?
can the care imparted duly with hate enshrined?
don’t our care for others waters satisfaction within us?
don’t our care for others
bring about the humanness within?
knowingly we care for others
because unknowingly we care for ourselves first.
if we are in pain we care only for ourselves
we hardly reign as saints;
if we are in love we care more for others
we hardly become devils;
choice is ours
saint or devil?
