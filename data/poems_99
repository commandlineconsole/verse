Woe to Women with Children!
The Unborn and Infants May be Most Susceptible, One Should Always Take Time to Research and Talk to Their Doctor Before Taking Any Action Themselves.
According to New Zealand Dermatology as much as ten percent of the population are currently or will become allergic to nickel.  And if you are one of those lucky persons, you have a ninety five percent chance of being allergic to the element chromium.  And if you're allergic to chrome you will also be allergic to cobalt.
These metals can be reduced to water soluble salt crystals so small as to be completely undetectable to the unaided eye.  In their larger forms some are used as reflective material that can decorate our eyes such as glitter, certain eye shadows, even reflective striping on clothing.  It was this reflective striping that originally alerted this reporter to these transitional metal elements which are found on the periodic table as Ni, Co, and Cr, after experiencing an allergic reaction to chrome.
It is recommended that anyone who is pregnant or planning to become pregnant or suffers from allergies talk to all their doctors about this, whether they are on current medication that may mimic one of these elements or just a worker who is exposed to these elements and may accidently bring them home with them.
