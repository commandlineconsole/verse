A BREATH OF HEAVEN
*~*
Every now and then,
when the world sits just right ~
a gentle breath of heaven
fills my soul with delight,
and I sigh,
as the sun brings its morning,
its gift of warmth to chase the chill ~
from the crook of night's arms
arising o'er that far hill,
and I know,
heaven smiles,
and I smile, too,
for life can be hard
while the dreams are few.
Yet, every now and then,
when the world sits just right ~
that gentle breath of heaven
fills my soul with delight,
and I see,
a turning of a leaf
dancing in the autumn's sun,
and a brilliant shade of crimson
glowing when the day is done,
and I sigh,
as the rose that stands alone,
thrives where no others thrive.
A rare bouquet of one ~
still strong, still alive,
and I know,
that even in the shadows
heaven catches, unaware,
those blinded by visions
of hatred and despair,
and I see,
a promise of tomorrow
in that wind around the bend,
as it carries a dream of hope ~
with no hate or pain to tend,
and I pray,
as every now and then,
when this world sits just right ~
that gentle breath of heaven
fills my soul with delight,
and I smile...I smile.
