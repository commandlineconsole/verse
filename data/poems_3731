WHO CARES?
I buy you diamonds, I buy you rings
But you don't care.
I buy you DVD's and things
But you still don't care.
I buy you everthin you want bling
Why don't you care?
I hold you close to me
You start to care.
I kiss your lips softly
Do you care?
I'll hold you forever
Because I'll always care.
