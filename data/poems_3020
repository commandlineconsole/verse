SORROW
Where there is sorrow there is pain
there is misery and an empty heart to gain
sorrow, misery, and pain can be a poetic train
a train that can keep you moving, moving toward the eye of the hurricane
the life you're living it's just the rain
the rain of your sorrows, the hurricane
the hurricane that stays in the ocean, sending off your rain
the rain that drives you insane
caving into your sorrows, painfully
the hurricane, slowly closing in on your hopes and dreams
and drowning out your screams and pleas
it makes your body tremble with ease
the ease of dying
and letting out your last breath, you know you've done your best
your best to swim out of your sorrows
while in the eye of the hurricane
