SERCHING
Searching.
In vain I search  but I search on,
Along life`s lonely corridor,
Seeking, seeking ever seeking,
Yet knowing not for what I`m searching,
But eagerly await each morrow,
Praying it will end this sorrow,
This sorrow I try so hard to hide
The tears that will not be denied,
The past is past, the joy, the pain,
I cannot live the past again,
But through the bitter mist must I
Search on.
