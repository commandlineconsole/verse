ANGRY
I'm so pissed
it's just dismissed
like there's nothing amiss.
I'm such a pushover
people just shove me off to the side
they don't even take cover,
so I run and hide.
Sometimes I just cry
My anger washed away
maybe I want to die.
I'll face my anger
take it and flip it upside down
like a frown
I'll pierce it with a dagger.
I'll move on
take life head on
Maybe I'm not such a moron.
