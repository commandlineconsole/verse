YOU DONT CARE
when i stare at you
you stare too
but never at me....
and now i see
you dont care
dont even go there
cause now i know
you dont care
ill never know where
i went wrong
it hasnt been long
since that horrible day
when nothing went my way
and now we're where
you dont care
no you never cared
but i do
