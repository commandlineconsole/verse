BLUE ROSE
Wish I could lay my eyes on the blue rose
Aches to touch it, caress the petals
Feel its texture on my skin
Smell its fragrance and have it stored in my memory
Need to touch need to feel
Close to the blue rose
See it bloom, fully share its passion and beauty in its core
Experience the blue rose
Listen to its dance
with the wind and sky
knowing and wanting it so much
such passion
Yet where is the blue rose
never existed
only lives in my mind
hoping its real
not a dream
