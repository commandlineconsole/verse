MY JOY
This comes from deep down within,
it feels me with warmth and love.
My joy is when I look at your face and I see a smile,
when I hear your laughted and see tear of joy.
Oh my joy.
This changes the world around me and people I know,
its fullfils my heart knowing you are safe in my arms.
When i call or you call me and tell me that you love me.
Oh my joy.
When I look at those tiny clothes in your wardrobe,
looking at your pics in phone and when I close my eyes.
Oh my joy.
