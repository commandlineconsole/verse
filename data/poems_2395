'ADDING FUEL TO THE FLAME'
When we play into the hands of anothers anger
We are only adding fuel to their flame.
And if it continues to burn out of control
Then who but yourself is really to blame?
It's what true anger feeds off!
Another's piling on more dry wood!
To fuel anger's flames my friend
Brings nothing but burnt feelings, not good!
Walk away, or snuff it's fire out!
Before it rages way out of control!
It is the only way you'll win anger's rage!
That battle of the fiery sparks one throws!
