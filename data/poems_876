FIRELIGHT
One light
A single light
Burning bright for tonight
Pain will come at morning’s light
Yet joy rings out for tonight
Gathered around the fire
Old friends meet once more
Fire, fire burning bright
In the forest in the night
Breaking pain for tonight
To come again at morning’s light
This flame, oh this blessed light
To give us joy when need is dire
May I thank god for the fire
Old friends meet once more
Around the fire that blessed door
This one light this blazing light
Bringing joy for tonight
Pain will come at morning’s light
Yet joy rings out for tonight
A flaming death, a forest fire
From this forest to the mire
This has brought joy when need is dire
These old friends meet once more
Gathered round this blessed door
Tomorrow they shall know no more
