INCOMPLETE
Two completely different worlds
Completely different altitudes
Completely different lives
Completely different attitudes
And yet it matters not
For so strongly my love burns
That the flames they do consume me
So my love for you burns
Yet the pain it is my pleasure
And the pleasure is in strife
I feel so completely incomplete
Without you in my life
So I ask you one more time
To let me in your world
For the thought of life without you
Just makes my blood curl
I wish you wanted me
I wish that you would act
Take me back my darling
Opposites attract
