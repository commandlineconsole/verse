THE TRUTH
You will survive and mustn't cry
You shan't worry
Use your pride
Forget the sorrowfulness, the woe
Bloom like a spring flower, let your petals grow
Shine like the sun, brightening every creature's day
Or ascend in the sky while the stars write your name
'Tis a shortcut, don't you see?
Towards where you want to go, just believe
Chasing your dreams, you shall succeed
Just let go
Forget the sorrowfulness, the woe
Be joyful, graceful like a young doe
Or be like a rainbow and let your colours show
And you'll find yourself with someone else...
Can't you tell?
'Tis a friend for you
Now you, indeed have dicovered the truth.
