ME
I love to play
I love to swim
I love piano
I passed Prelim
I love to read
I love to write
I love daytime
I love the night
I love to sleep
I love to eat
Exciting people
I love to meet
I love netball
I love dogs
I love guinea pigs
I love frogs
I love my family
I love my friends
With me the good times
Never end
I love to learn
So I love school
I think it's fair to say...
THAT I RULE! ! !
