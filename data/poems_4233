FEAR NOTHING BUT ONE
Fear Love for it will kill you both in such thrill
Makes you suffer when you're happy
Makes you perish when you're ill
Fear it for it makes you decide in such a deadly way
Makes you choose if you are for your happiness
Makes you decide to work or play
Fear Dark for it will blind you and always let you fall
Makes you fall without such judgment
Makes you cry in no such call
Fear it for it makes you clueless and not updated and aware
Makes you tremble without knowing
Makes you hardly even care
Fear Needles for it will bleed you and strike you in the eye
Makes you suffer bleeding hard
Makes you simply knowing you're alive
Fear it for it will simply have a permanent scar on your face
Makes you feel be wasted
Makes you wanted it to erase
Fear everything else but nothing beats them all but him
God sets the beginning of everything
God sets the end of everything
Fear him for he can do anything even impossible in the eye
God will make you face your fear
God will make you sigh
