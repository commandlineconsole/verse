FEAR
Fear is when you run away,
Fear is when you are scared to love,
Fear is when the sky turns black,
Fear is when you use your loved ones,
Fear is a feeling of danger,
Fear is when you are'nt brave,
Fear is when you cant behave,
Fear is the feeling of anger,
Fear is when you go all shy,
Fear is like not having devotion,
Fear is when you're afraid,
Fear is like a dark blue ocean,
Fear is like the ending of your career,
Fear is being lonely,
Fear is like feeling ghostly,
Fear is like an ashtray,
Fear is like a dark dungeon.
