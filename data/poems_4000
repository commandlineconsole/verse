WHEN NO ONE CARES
It all goes fuzzy and then it fades to black
Nothing seems to matter and no one looks back
Seems nothing is appreciated and no one really listens
This is what happens when no one cares
Whimpers in the darkness and tears stain the face
No one notices and the days pass on by without leaving a trace
All alone for hours with little to do-insane inside the madness
This is what happens when no one cares
Wonder what it would be like if I were to die
Would they get along- would they even try
Could life pass before them -not caring enough
This is what happens when no one cares
It is so sad to think we all are so close
But light years apart where it matters most
Everyone is wrapped up in their own little world
This is what happens when no one cares
Feelings of emptiness and feelings of shame
Sadness takes over, it replaces the love and it becomes a game
Pain and sorrow become friends just a loneliness arise
This is what happens when no one cares
