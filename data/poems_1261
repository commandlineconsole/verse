EXPLOSION OF EMOTION
What is love: tenderness, softly whispered
words, overcome with a sense of awe and
delight and joyous feelings spiralling deep
inside like a maelstrom increasing in power
yet also perfectly contained within the most
noble ideals & marvellous reverence - while
feeling affection - intertwined with electricity
magnetism and light in short - an explosion
of emotion -that increases in force as time
goes by and the distance covered is never
shortened by fading moments - every hour
leading to increasing ecstasy until slumber
claims the mind and heart just to renew the
power to repeat the performance and a new
jaunt on the stage of life with the applause
of invisible awareness accompanying our
every move augmenting the emotions to
create visual patterns expressing delight
