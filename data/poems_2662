SADNESS
It was a shadowy night,
The wind pushing and snapping trees,
The lightning like a silent torch,
The thunder bellowing sadness,
Finally it reaches me,
It grabs me and doesn't let go,
It is now my prison,
I cannot escape,
Sadness controls me now,
The emotion burrowing deep inside of me,
It blinds me of the joys of life,
It confines me to only darkness,
Then again the lightning burns the sky,
The thunder bellows nothing but sadness,
Stronger this time,
I have to fight this,
I must,
I can,
I try,
I do not succeed,
The bonds are too strong,
I struggle,
I wriggle,
I writhe,
But nothing seems to be able to free me,
Nothing.
