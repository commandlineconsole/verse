WHAT WILL IT BE
Yesterday i feel so dejected
I feel that the whole world is against me
How can they be so happy when i'm not
Today i feel so estastic
I feel that the whole world is with me
How can they not be happy when i am
Who knows what tomorrow might bring
Will it be a day of sadness or happiness?
Will it be a day of anger or joy?
Will it be a day of many surprises?
Will it be a day of relaxation or complete exhaustion?
Which would you like it to be?
Me i prefer happiness to sadness
but sadness seem to follow me often nowadays
Joy to anger & a surprise or two will be welcome
Complete exhuastion is good from time to time
It help keep your mind of things
by the end of the day, a good night sleep
Tomorrow is another day, good or bad it's up to you
