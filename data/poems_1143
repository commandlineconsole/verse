BALLERINAS DELIGHT SONNET #51
Ballet a formulaic, structured dance
Performed with pink, posed, pointed, precision
Historic display and filled with romance
My child’s delight recaptures my vision
Senses enhanced by pink netting and lace
Spinning, leaping and gracefully agile
Effortless movement despite a fierce pace
Like discoveries - fast, fleeting and fragile
Girl’s flirtation echoed in pirouettes
Strenuous, stepping and perfect poses
Pathos and beauty removed from regrets
Ballerinas delight like pink roses
Art reflects life both the cruel and the kind
Dancers uplift both the heart and the mind
