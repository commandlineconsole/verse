THE SADNESS OF LONELINESS
THE SADNESS OF LONELINESS
The sadness of loneliness-
I had forgotten it-
I have been away for a long time
But now in the late afternoon
In the quiet and emptiness
Of the usually bustling streets
It comes back to me quietly-
The sadness of loneliness
That we are alone in the world
Each one of us alone
And that sometimes no matter
Where we are
We remember it-
The sadness of loneliness
A Quiet sadness
A sad sadness
A lonely sadness
Alone.
