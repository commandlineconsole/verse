DARK.
the tear is like a spark of lonely house
the darkness crawl over the sand, grass, water
the happiness is just like one second
but sadness is like a million years
the darkness is like our boar dome or can be sadness
but happiness is like 12 noon of the the sun
like how different flowers bloom at different times
like that, at different times people shoot up....
