CHASING SORROWS
Whole of my life
I spent
in chasing happiness
but to an every end
I found
perplexities and dilemma
consequence was only
sorrows of life.
I  view the ratio
of joys and sorrows
I  find
sorrowa are at lion portion
of my life.
And my life is spent
only in an endeavour
to overcome
sorrows of my life
and to achieve
joys in my life
still the span of joys
is too little
with compare to sorrows.
Perhaps sorrow hails
as gift for life
to increase span of life
