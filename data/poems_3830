WHY ARE BUTTERFLIES FREE?
A butterfly goes thru one of lives greatest metamorphoses.
It starts its life as a caterpillar going thru life eating and waiting for that moment to begging its life’s journey. It cocoons itself until it is ready for its last steps in life.
Spring forth from its cocoon, it frees itself and flies off into the light. It is its begging and ending all at the same time.
It doesn’t care about what the future brings
It doesn’t care about lesser things
It doesn’t care about the rain
It doesn’t care about the pain
It doesn’t care about where it belongs
It doesn’t care about a silly love songs
It doesn’t care about right or wrong
It doesn’t care about the road being to long
It doesn’t care if the sun sets in the east
It doesn’t care about war and piece
It doesn’t care about the world in helter skelter
It doesn’t care about a warm shelter
It has no idea about mass destruction
For that takes too much contemplation
For politics it has no reaction
It needs no constitution
Just being is its satisfaction
It looks to no one for absolution
No homeland for repatriation
It has no skin for condemnation
It has no time for recreation
It has no room for damnation
A butterfly lives its life like there is no tomorrow
For a butterfly there is no tomorrow
A butterfly just wonders the earth sapping up life as it goes by
It owes nothing to anyone
Fly butterfly, fly and be free
Be free to be free
