LOVE TOOK ME BY SURPRISE
Once you took me by surprise
That day you insisted to take my hand,
I was so shy so afraid,
this was so new to me.
That day you looked into my eyes,
and I looked into yours,
you found love in mine,
I found love in yours.
When you less expected it,
I took your hand,
I fell in love,
and you did with me.
I remember your eyes,
I took you by surprise,
I felt so much love in you,
and you did with me.
That same day you told me for the first time,
those magnificent and beautiful three words,
those that took me by surprise again,
you told me
''I love you''
That day I understood the magic of love,
how does t works...
I spent all my life planning it,
but when I found it, it was just not what i planned.
Love took me by surprise, and it will always take me by surprise..
