THE FAMILY AFFAIR
Its a family affair
With problems everywhere
But nobody cares
And lots of people stare
Its hectid and crazy
With confusion and drama
It has babies and different ladies
And to many baby mommas
Its a family affair
And nobody cares
You say thier just friends
With just a kiss and a hug
But yall are like Barbie and Ken
Im not stupid duh
Its a family affair
And nobody cares
Stop with the lies
Just tell me the truth
You might make me cry
But you know i have proof
Its a family affair
But nobody cares
nobody
just
nobody
