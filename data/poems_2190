SO ANGRY, SO SAD
Anger is a form of fear
Anger is a force that can never die
Anger building up
Anger is a virus
Anger is a like vicious circle it goes,
around and around
Anger,
The root of all evil
Anger is such a strong emotion
So angry,
So sad
Anger is bubbling away at me
I have good reason to be angry
No one understand,
No one cares
It tears out my heart
