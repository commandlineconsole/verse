FLOWER HAS BEGUN TO OPEN
Within the magical feeling
Pulsed the energy and strength
Many may reach this passion
Physical pleasure just a minor thing.
A touch, a thought, a feeling
The power can be transferred
Endless variety and completeness
Within the connection now.
A vision of time within time
Where all thoughts begin
A place were the purity is unsurpassed
Where passion is consumed.
Here lies the reason
The place we all seek
For within this subconscious thought
The flower has begun to open wide.
