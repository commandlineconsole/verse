ALONE
Alone
The only person here is I
All Alone
The not firm tears roll down
I look out into the confused world
The world passes this insecure person by
I try to sing a song of bliss
In hopes it will bring me out of my sorrowfulness
Somedays I choose to be alone
No one seems to understand this sometimes foolish person
Alone, I guess, is how I need to be
I will never understand it
Even though I will question it
All alone
Just alone
No one to talk to of what I am feeling from within
