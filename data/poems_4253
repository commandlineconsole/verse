FEAR
Fear
far away
When fear pounces
it takes hold of your throat
can't breathe
until suddenly
the moment
is over
I'm happiest
when I'm terrified
It brings out the best in me
Missing out
are the people
with everlasting confidence
Leaving nothing in the hands
of fear
Someone wise once told me
let fear have you
Let it grab you
when you're scared
Let it take you
to unimagined places
Let it make you dream
of unimagined things
Someone wise once said
let fear have you
Let it seize you
in the moment
Let it make you
into someone
you didn't know existed
Let it make you be
an unimagined you
