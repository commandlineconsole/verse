FEAR
Fear
I am consumed by fear of the unknown,
My life has changed to unbearable,
I have fear that is telling me I am not good enough
And I will be never be, I fear acceptance to the world,
I fear to express my soul to the world, I cannot speak,
My language and words are not up to standard,
My fear has cut out my tongue, I cannot sing
i'm like a caged bird, I am bound.
My fear is unknown.
I miss my youth, when I was free and full of life
I was ready to take life as it comes,
I had freedom of speech,
I had freedom of movement,
I was free of fear, the fear of the unknown.
I know that I am special; I am protected by the higher power,
I know that I 'm sent for the purpose,
But the fear that Iâ€™m consumed by made me lose my focus.
My False evidence appearing real
My fear of the unknown.
