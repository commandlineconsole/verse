THE DROPPED
Given her up he
Completely long back from heart
No more of concerns
'Get out, out'he says
In gruff anger as often
Very rough these days
She knows the reason
His wrong weakness and vices
And he knows she knows
What then, avoids her
Trying his best to divorce
But she doesn't stoop
She trusts her children
Who have grown up with good jobs
That they will guard her
Wise they console her
Different with coated words
She knows what it means
'Oh, don't worry mom
We can look after ourselves
Won't bother you'
'Know the way to earn
Can send you enough money
You can be peaceful'
For that beaten heart
High time what is needful more?
Justice and support
