NEW ANGER
New anger came across the dull, brown yard
New anger trotted up the stone steps
New anger rang the bell
Hello new anger
I can come out to play
But I might not be the friend youâ€™re hoping for
I might become undone
Upset
And you will wish you had not asked
Me to be your friend
New anger you had better stay away
Go home new anger
Loneliness is better than remorse
