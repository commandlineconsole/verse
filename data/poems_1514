REPLY TO LYNDA'S DRINKING POEM
I would share
My days of happiness;
Everything is folly in this world
That does not give us pleasure.
Let us enjoy life,
For the pleasures of drinking are swift and fleeting
As a flower that lives and dies
And can be enjoyed no more when one has over imbibed
Let’s take our pleasure!
While its ardent,
Brilliant summons lures us on.
So my friends pick up your glasses
And sing again to Lord Dionysus’s song
