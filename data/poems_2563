EVERYWHERE I AM/MY SADNESS COMES BACK TO ME
Everywhere I am
My sadness comes back to me-
Sadness it seems
Is part of my essential self
I carry it with me like a signature.
One day perhaps in some perfect heaven
I will not find it within me
But now here in this world
Where even the greatest Goodness and Happiness
May know loss
It is with me always
Even if sometimes only as a possibility-
Sadness goes with me wherever I go
And I am sadness it seems in some of my essence-
Bless the light of the day and the beauty of the world
And those moments of rare exuberance
In which Sadness is not.
