MAN IS POTATO.
Ego wounded, anger bursts.
Senses purred, desires spurt.
The built in anger and desire
Work as drives for man efforts.
Assaulted by a white in Africa,
Gandhi fought against the whites in India.
Enamoured by the cute Cleopatra,
Julius Caesar helped her get her throne.
It’s anger that spurs you.
It’s desire that tempts you.
Without anger or desire
A man is mere potato.
