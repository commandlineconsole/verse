SADNESS
My heart weeps tears of sadness
Sadness that i cant seem to escape
Alone in the dark wondering bout my next move
Going to be the right or wrong?
That's a dilemma i have to figure out
No more light shining, all is dark
Darkness like in the depth of an endless cave
Cant seem to find my way around
Lost in my many thoughts,
Thoughts that are nightmares when i sleep
Everything is now blank and still
Wondering what to do next..
No more air, my soul is dying
As my heart weeps tears of sadness
