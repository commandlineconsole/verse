IN EVERY GARDEN OF DELIGHT
IN EVERY GARDEN OF DELIGHT
In every garden of delight
There is a hidden world of fright
In every line of poetry
Another stanza lies unseen.
Surfaces define our mind
For the zealous saints half- blind
Under earth and far away
A different music always plays-
We as fools to ourselves
Do not know our inner wealth
The mirror mars the color we are
Dust of rainbow- secret stars-
