I WENT TO THE SOUL OF MY SADNESS AND SAID
I WENT TO THE SOUL OF MY SADNESS AND SAID
I went to the soul of my sadness and said
‘Why are you? ’
And it said
‘The world does not need you’
And I asked again, ’ Why’
And my soul said,
‘Because you in all you do are not very good’
And I continued writing a poem
Even I must try to believe in.
