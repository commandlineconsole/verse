I TRIED TO REMEMBER THE SADNESS OF ALL THE POEMS I HAD NOT WRITTEN
I TRIED TO REMEMBER THE SADNESS OF ALL THE POEMS I HAD NOT WRITTEN
I tried to remember the sadness
Of all the poems
I had not written-
But by this time
After so many lines
Those poems have been overwhelmed
By the sadness of those I had written
Which I also imperfectly remember-
Life is sadness
Poems are sadness
Remembrance is sadness
Even the dreams which pass by our window
As we try to sleep
Are sadness
Sadness is All
And Life is a Sadness
Even Poetry cannot redeem.
