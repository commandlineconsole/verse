TEAR DROPS OF JOY
Tear dropp of joy when a baby is bron
Tear dropp of joy  when your  mother and father tell you that they love you
Tear dropp of joy when my  boyfriend bring me a dozen of roses
Tear dropp of joy when I see two people holding hands
Tear drops of joy when all the family come over for a sunday dinner
and I stand back and watch everyone enjoy every one
A Tear come down with joy.....
