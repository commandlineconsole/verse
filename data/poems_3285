TO WHOM IT CONCERNS
To whom it concerns
I yelled at my teacher
but who cares he airn't no precher
To whom it concerns
my homework is going to be late
I will jst say it fell on my panckes and stuck to the plate
To whom it concerns
I faled my test
no one cares
that i did my best
To whom it concerns
I see alot
no one cares about the fight that we fought
To whom it concerns
I see alot of pain
but don't worry
this is just the begining of the lain.
