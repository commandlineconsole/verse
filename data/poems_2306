4.10 ANGER
Anger makes a dull man witty,
But keeps him poor in eternity,
A man shrinks when he is angry,
And grows in tranquil serenity.
When anger flow in the body,
You lose your temper - your folly,
When distempered - a tragedy,
You lose reason - a calamity.
Anger at lies last in infinity,
Anger at truth is momentary,
Speech - when you are angry,
Will but make you feel sorry.
It is not worth being angry,
And any threat is a folly,
Reason is your tool mighty,
Think of consequences finally.
Anger causes resentment only,
A headache and tension clearly,
Forgiveness propels growth surely,
With laughter and lightness totally.
