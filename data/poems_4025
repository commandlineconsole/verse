HOW TO TREAT A GENTLE SOUL
When you touch a gentle soul
approach them softly
see them as a person
see them as a whole
realize that inside their heart
the might be nursing a gaping hole
where love used to be
beating and swollen
before it was broken
or irrepairably injured
or stolen
Speak in gentle tones
that comfort and nurse
like kidleather gloves
or aoft black lambskin purse
with a pearl button clasp
that buttons with ease
like the summer downdraft breeze
that bends up the ends of the leaves of the trees
and do not depart until you caress their heart
because that is the most meaningful part
Extend them your hand
palm open and fingers free
eye's downward and on bended knee
so that they know you come to serve
and to calm and soothe
until the sadness you help them remove
like Fall leaves from a yard with a gentle sweep and rake
and always give them more than you take
so they'll know your kindness was certain
and not a ruse or mistake
And if you should see them cry
let them know its OK
and softly kiss the tear from their eye
and show that for them you'll try
not mistreat them or wish them goodbye
because you know how it feels to cry
and feel like the stars have fallen from the sky
and nobody can tell you why
or if they'll ever return
as you feel the burn
of all that has gone awry
If they should reach to hold your hand
silently say you understand
hold them softly and let kindness flow
so they can feel your hearbeat and know
that caring is real and not simply for show
that's the way it has to go
when the soft winds of caring blow
and emotional waves of caring grow
shoveling sadness bit by bit
as if it was heavy frozen Winter snow
If they rest their head upon your shoulder
sit tall and stronger and bolder
so they can feel your strength secure
as their broken heart you seek to cure
with caring simple and pure
soft like satin, so gentle and kind
and stay there as they silently unwind
the things heavy in their heart and mind
so they'll know that others care
and they might find faith
that some see while all were thought blind
And if your eyes should meet
in a human moment, don't be remiss
on their forehead, softly, do kiss
because caring is like this
a moment to treasure and not to miss
fill a broken heart with care
and you'll be rewarded with grace and bliss
because Heaven is made of care like this
Gentle souls are only mended with care and gentleness
