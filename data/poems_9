**PLATONIC LOVE
my magic heart- shaped black coral
and your zenith rock solid beauty
ignite our  inflammable
emerald passions
but I am a
cock
castrated by
promises given to
another hen, a fear gripped
in the lion heart  of mine  to  earn
ignominious fame  so I sing the  song of
love  like a cage- bird though my rhythm stolen
by the burden of  life  I descend   every
night to the roof of your fairy
dreams though my
wings are cut
by
the piping
eyes of bigots,
I hear  the waves of the
sound carry the urge of your
mysterious mystic  eyes though some
jealous created a wall  I smell your  showering
breath in  the flowers though the gardener leads  the
bees after me  some sharks make hindrance to
taste your smile in the still  waters still
I pray to make you free  from the
blistering spell of charms of
our love to be happy to
prance  around
and
give me
all the pain  of
cuts of neighbours tongues.
