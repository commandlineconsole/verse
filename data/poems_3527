GOOD TO ME
Good to Me
Day to day troubles try pushing me there
Shoving my back to the wall
Worldly concerns had me going nowhere
Making me feel two feet small
Down deep inside I know who of I am
Who gave my life just to be
Worldly concerns are but small grains of sand
Natural treasures are free
Steadfastly holding on to my belief
‘bout the creation of all
Foll’wing your wisdom to gain my release
Short setbacks won’t make me fall
Lovin’ your plan and singin’ your song
That’s all I ever can do
Knowing my bound’ries when something goes wrong
Drawing me closer to you
Giving your perfect gift
And giving me sight to see
Giving me understanding, lord
You’ve been good to me
Arr-o-gant rulers are turned into chaff
Unlawful priestly are too
Learning your children can see through the mask
Wonderin’ what they’re gonna do
Ritually hiding their head in the mud
Hoping their promise you’ll keep
Coming to know that their plans were but dust
Treasures are safe with the meek
Thank you for giving me life on this earth
Lord you’ve been good to me
