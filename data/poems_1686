CREATE THE LIFE
Once we create the course of life,
We ride and commit jesting and joking.
A trained man has life, so much life,
Then we train the symbols of love.
Poems are goodness, but well is the poet
That he created life, so much of it.
This I confess, this I express,
And more leisure is trained, as more is loved.
The creative spirit is extended
To the worlds of pleasure, pleasure can
Dissolve into the oceans and then work
With reminding.
