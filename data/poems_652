PASSION INTO ACTION
The Moon Shines Bright
You Hold Thee Tight
Secure In Your Arms
Taken by your Charms
Lost in Passions
That I will not Ration
The Cold Wind Blows
Through Our Bodies
My Body On Fire
To You I Aspire...To Desire
To Take Thee Higher
A flame has been lit
illuminated, ablaze
With Passion
Taken into action
Take Me
Explore Me
Become One With Me
