BE MY BEST FRIEND?
A stupid fight
It broke us up
Late that night
I was mean
I swore
I acted like I didn’t care
But really I wished my best friend was there
You tried to warn me
As o said best friends forever
You said it always
Ends in never
You said don’t do this
I said I don’t care
But really I wished my best friend was there
You sent message after message
I sent swear after swear
I didn’t feel right
When you said you didn’t care
I should have been happy
I should have not cared
But my heart hurt
Completely tea red
Why did I say that?
Why the stupid fight
I did care
And it took all my might
Not to cry that night
I miss you
No don’t think that
It’s my fault
But I couldn’t help but care
I just wish my best friend was there
I cried and cried
I missed you
My heart had died
I wanted you back
I called and called
But all I got was goodbye
And all I did was cry and cry
So I write this
Ten months later
After the day of June 9th
To get my best friend back
And to say my apology
But not to say goodbye
I’m here to say I’m sorry
To my best friend, once again.
