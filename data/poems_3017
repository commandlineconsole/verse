NO SORROW DROPS DOWN FROM HEAVEN
Entwined i feel loved
Embraced by a stranger with warmth and passion
The cockroach interrupts the ceremony and i kill him
No sorrow drops from Heaven
Entwined i feel loved
Embraced by a stranger so often now, i cannot stand it
Imagine getting angry from excess ecstasy but u cannot
For my day is filled with intercourse that would make you blush
My day, unlike any others is carnal in it's essence
My day, is unique each day and so is my lover
But i wondered at that moment
As the cockroach interrupted my ceremony and i killed him
When someone human interrupts my ceremony how will i act?
Moreover a most urgent question-
When i am defunct will sorrow dropp from Heaven?
I pray for that  because
What sorrows have value except the ones for me?
I look back at the roach and see that suddenly he is beautiful
His sleek light brown coat looks like a bikers leather jacket
and he is smiling, contentedly.
Someday, so will I.
Contentedly filled with embalming fluid
While a miniscule throng passes by to pay respects
I am grinning inside
knowing I never died
Sorrow comes from hell
all is well all is well
No sorrow drops down from heaven
