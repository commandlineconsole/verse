A RATHER SPECTACULAR SUNRISE
I've seen many a spectacular sunrise
Fishing in cold mountain night
Waiting for something to bite
Just me… a doe and fawn
Waiting for the warm dawn
I've seen many a spectacular sunrise
Before light...walking on the beach
Puzzling over a dream I couldn't reach
Light ~  as if a promise of better tomorrow
Dawn ~ to wash away my frivolous sorrow
I've seen many a spectacular sunrise
Sun rays still below the horizon ….rising
Air warmed by faint light seems surprising
Then bright yellow ..a touch of blazing red
Rays that intrude into my eyes and bed
I've seen many a spectacular sunrise
Wondering of my dream as I did arise
Dreamed of sunrise reflected in her eyes
Morning light..as nature lifts her disguise
Assumed cookie cutter day of little surprise
That morning she saw a spectacular sunrise
Particularly cold night had flown slowly by
To move beyond the daze she had to try
Sunrise was quite spectacular that day
After the night her mother passed away
