FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN
We fear death but the true facts of the matter it is only the fear of death that we fear
And the feared grim reaper always very busy he takes people every day of the year
He takes the old, the middle aged and the young and he takes men and women in their prime
And he claims the billionaire and the poor pauper and he can come at an unexpected time.
None have returned to tell us about the hereafter for all we know there may not be such a place
But death and life are both a part of Nature it is only the fear of death we fear to face
It is as natural for to die as to live and all things of life are born for to die one day
But perhaps the soul destined to live forever only the body goes into decay.
It is the fear of the unknown that scares us for not one yet has any proof to show
That there is life beyond an Earthly existence we only fear the things we do not know
Yet the grass that's dormant in the months of Winter in the warmth of the Spring again will grow
And Nature lives on with her passing Seasons and people to the Planet come and go.
When we fear death it is the unknown we fear that we just live one life and then no more
That there will never be a life hereafter we will not live beyond our Earthly shore
We fear the unknown that is all that we fear and the reaper will pay everyone a call
And we are born to live awhile and then die for life and death are part of Nature after all.
