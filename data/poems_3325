FELONS AND TALONS
I concern those felons with talons,
Fixing their teeth in the head.
Crime may be criminals, it describes,
The description and narrative of a true story
Ignites new religions of splendour.
My concern is over felons who have talent
Over the truth, the crime is busting.
Bursting forth is the criminal boast,
He roasts and clicks like a programmer of distrust,
Minding his business never,
Mincing his words in need of more and more,
The cash is enough for rich school.
