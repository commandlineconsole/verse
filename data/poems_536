ONWARDS FROM DEPRESSION
I feel contented now that you
Are here and in my life,
Can I but hope that you’ll become
Someone dear with passion rife?
Will you take hold and love me dear?
Will pleasures melt away?
When wondrous thoughts and touches
Make love to me each day.
Will love of you bring tenderness
In ways that are yet to come?
Will subtle thoughts and passions dwell
Within minds ablaze with thoughts
Of how and why, and when and more
That we do hold each other
In passionate embraces for
One day will melt into t’other.
Will your sojourn with me last long?
Will passions slowly weaken?
Will sombre thoughts invade this song?
Or happiness awaken?
May our time together become full of love
May passion pervade our thoughts
May tenderness and love abound
Or may all become just nought.
