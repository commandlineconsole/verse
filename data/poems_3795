I DON'T CARE
I don't care how u feel about me;
I don't care if u know that I exist;
I don't care if u give another vows;
I don't care that it's not my touch u miss;
I don't care if u move oceans away;
I don't care that your pets aren't mine, too;
I don't care if I never love some other;
I don't care-if u know that I love u.
