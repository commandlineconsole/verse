HAPPINESS AND JOY
when you look for yourself and find
this self
within your heart
and you touch this self
so lovingly
with the understanding of your mind
you have found happiness
like you put your hands behind your back
and embrace your shoulders
fleeting and sometimes
tiring this search
of self that ends sometimes
in questioning
how long does this last?
this won't
it will pass but it may come again
but to last
it will not
you either go deeper
or you go higher
always beyond yourself
to find another
a heart to your heart
a mind to your mind
you talk you understand you reach for another hand
you kiss, you make love, you share each other 's bodies
each other's long lonely nights
this can be more than happiness
we call this joy
but you go deeper this time or higher if you
prefer it
this search for joy greater than joy
this joy beyond bodies beyond nights beyond hands
beyond time
eternal happiness, this is joy greater than joy
we sense it
but not completely
we sense it when we look at the eyes of the person we love
and who loves us in return
truthfully and so beautifully
the feelings in our hearts
as we sleep and make love and dream and stay together
with clasped hands
we have mere glimpses
vague but it is there
it is the joy that always lurks but cannot fully make us see
we are too small yet
too young to fully dance the steps and leaps of this
i am still looking for this
this joy
i know it is there, but i just can't utter it
i must know better
i live some more and perhaps if need be
die and then travel and be there
beyond, yes always this feeling of beyond
my armpit is warm and my eyes are still rolling
i am holding it
i have it in my heart but not competely
and so i ramble
in so much waiting, this impatience
but lovely still, and yes, so beautiful....tomorrow.

It is far better to seek 'joy.' Joy is related to happiness, but it is a deeper experience. In the search for happiness the individual focuses upon himself, but joy moves a person out of a self-centered preoccupation and provides an orientation towards others. Joy is an experience which connects us to that which is 'Greater' than we are. It connects us to the creative power that is more than the 'I' or ego. Joy gets us out of ourselves and in contact with this 'Other' and with others. Joy can sustain us throughout the four phases of life. If we are willing to give up the search for happiness, we may find joy. It exists near the center of the wheel where happiness and suffering meet and intermingle.
