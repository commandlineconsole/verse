THE SADNESS OF LIFE IS NOT ITS ONLY POEM
THE SADNESS OF LIFE IS NOT ITS ONLY POEM
The sadness of life is not its only poem-
There are other poems-
Poems of love and happiness-
Poems of laughter-
Poems of being with those one loves-
The sadness of life is not its only poem-
Life has many poems-
Happy ones, also.
