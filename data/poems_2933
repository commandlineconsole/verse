SORROW
Together we fall into bed at night
There he remains when I rise in the morn
Our eyes flutter open in perfect sync
Feet touch the floor as we begin our day
Throughout the whole day he follows me
Ever-shedding the tears I cry inside,
My unfading imaginary friend,
Sorrow is my shadow, my brother, kin
I invited him here as a comfort
I thought he could take away all my pain
Now the swirling darkness is here to stay
My brilliant smile now an eternal frown
Sorrow is my shadow, my brother, kin
My unfading imaginary friend
Twas I he’d been ever-longing to hold
Not alone...I’ve never been lonelier
Sorrow – deepest dark pain a soul can feel
Sorrow – reddest wet blood a soul can bleed
Sorrow – heaviest weight a soul can bear
Sorrow – most torturous death a soul dies
Always haunts me, sorrow is my shadow
Mimicking me, my shadow is a mime
Except that he whispers of what could be
He is a lead weight I drag on a chain
Sorrowful shadows have me bound and gagged
Whispering sorrowful words in my ear
My unfading imaginary friend,
Sorrow is my shadow, my brother, kin.
