FLOWING
Pain and Anger are the things
In which is flowing through my veins
Knowing that I am forever
Trapped in this endles web of game
Knowing that I'll never be the same
The lonliness you can not measure
For I can no longer bear
The pain I encounter as I stay here
Pain and Anger are the things
In which is flowing through my veins
But is that all that is there
I see a search for love which ends in Despair.
Let me know i am not alone
Let me know I have a place I can call home
Let me know that you are there
Please tell me I have nothing to Fear.
Pain and Anger, Flowing through my veins
Right down to the core
I dont know if I can take it anymore
Is there something else
Or is this the end.
Let me know I have a friend.
Am I loved or No.
Are you friend or Foe.
Do I have to go through this Alone.
I guess I do.
No one is here.
Because No one cares.
Pain and Anger are the things
In which is flowing through my veins
I dont know how long I can
Stay Sane
In this mindless torture
Pain and Anger
Anger and Pain
Tell me can you feel it
Flowing through your veins?
