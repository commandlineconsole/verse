FEAR
Fear exists
In every mind
Some fear death
Some fear life
There is fear all around
Some fear struggle
Some fear strife
The problem is their
Attitude
Fear does not solve
Problems
Fear does not give
Solution
Fear is an enemy
Which makes a person?
Weak and unsuccessful
Fear harms the health
Eats the wealth
It snatches the smile
Makes one cry
Help your self
Get rid of fear
Work hard
Try for the best
Think positive
Live life like
Never before
