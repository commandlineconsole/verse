SADNESS COMES WITH FEAR
SADNESS COMES WITH FEAR
Sadness comes with fear,
Dread of what might be-
We live assuming we will be able to go on-
We do not know
What the next day will bring.
As long as there is a ‘for now’
We close our minds to the inevitable.
But one day the inevitable happens
And all is changed beyond our worst dreams.
Oh God not now not yet Please.
