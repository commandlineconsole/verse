A MORNINGS WORD 11/02/07
All these bits and pieces
that have fallen in disrepair
as a broken heart unleashes
all the sadness and despair
upon the fartherest reaches
as slowly it pervades
upon my soul it leaches
how completely it invades
as the tears that seem to ever flow
down upon my face
to find themselves ever so
oh so out of place
and there the pain and sorrow
seem to have taken root
and upon my emotions borrow
to pillage there and loot
all these bits and pieces
that have fallen in disrepair
as a broken heart unleashes
all the sadness and despair
