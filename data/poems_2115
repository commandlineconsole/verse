GIVE ME YOUR LOVE
Give me your love that's true
Darling anything is possible
It's all up to me and you
For the times never to be dull
The night with stars above
Is much in our feelings now
Everything is made of love
That moves here to and fro
Give your heart tonight
From inside your eyes
And touch
Everything feels so right
In its surprise
And loving you so much
When we two together are
Everything's feeling so fine
Like music from bar to bar
Or summer with sunshine
When we two together are
Day and night peace and war
It's all up to me and you
Give your heart tonight
From inside your eyes
And touch
Everything feels so right
In its surprise
And loving you so much
When we two together are
Everything's feeling so fine
Like music from bar to bar
Or summer with sunshine
Everything that we two do
Is like our love - forever new
