I AM A GREAT PASSION!
I am a great passion!
I want to reap your soul to mine
Know that I am a great passion that will consume your mind
Your senses aflame with the fires I light
You will desire me so, do you see any point in flight
Throbbing, breathless till I relieve your sweet agony
I decide, to hold or grant the ecstasy
All this and more, your dreams will come true
Only if your soul longs for me too!
