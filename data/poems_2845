TIME TOO LATE
You may think I'm chasing you
Or trying to make a date
I promise that's not on my mind
My time is much too late
I do, however, care for you
More than you'll ever know
And though I try to flirt with you
Just laugh and let it go
Humour me or laugh at me
But never do forget
That all you'll evr see in me
Is sadness and regret
Sadness that our paths
So many years apart
Have only just this now entwined
And wrapped around my heart
