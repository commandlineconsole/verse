LET US BUILD
It did pose a problem
But did not concern them
As time was the factor
Everybody was champion and victor
Body was well built
Ready to move any side and tilt
Ready to charge and go ahead
Determined to move and provide the lead
Such is youth of today
Resolve in mind to find way
Only need little help and care
Rest all they can find and dare
I have found them to be honest
Always worried to perform the best
Not concerned with what lies ahead
Yet with strong urge ready to be read
Open sky is the limit
Science has opened doors to greet
With new challenges
And with vigor to implement in age
Let us be fair
Provide them free environment and air
They will build new future for us
With enough of room for confidence and trust
They are living with zeal
That speaks of intent real
We are not coming out of old habitat
Let the road lay open at present
Do not stop their hunt
Let them bear the brunt
They have no vision but sight
To look beyond with light
I shall prove it with examples
They have stood amidst troubles
They may perform it once gain
Let us build them strong even in pain
