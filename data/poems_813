MY CHRISTINE JOY
In my life, only one girl gives me joy;
A joy i had always dreamed no one can ever destroy.
Especially when in our life, every second we would enjoy,
That's why i consider her as my helen of troy,
She has the beauty that would attract every boy.
I hope and pray that i will never lose my joy,
My one and only love, my dear CHRISTINE JOY.
