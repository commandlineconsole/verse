WE MUST NOT FORGET YOU
Remember all your love,
Though every day is new;
For feelings come above,
To dwell inside of you.
The stars are all crying,
The day has lost its light;
For innocents were dying,
Into the dull some night.
We must not forget you,
Who have now gone away;
And even though we do,
When there comes a new day.
Remembering our lost ones,
Will follow us in time;
Parents, daughters and sons,
Victims to this evil crime.
What's the purpose of this?
Why make such sorrowfulness?
Now, as we loved ones miss,
We all feel this aimlessness.
