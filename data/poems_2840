I JUST DON'T GET IT
The animals, the flowers, the insects and all nature in the world,
Makes me happy,
But the death of someone I love,
The death of an animal,
And a friend upset,
All make me sad,
Because a life of death and sadness isn’t really worth living,
Yet here we are in a world of poverty, death and sadness,
I just don’t get it.
