MOVE TOWARDS LIFE JOY
Banish old doubts and all your tears
And move towards life's joy my dear
For you can find it behing the shadow
Of troubles and pains tranquil meadow
So better instead of feeling sad
And thinking of bad things you had
Move forward life's happy days
And count your blessings in fainly ways
So count your decades by lovely flowers
And all your years with pleasure's hour
For they both let you fainly drive
On the long and hard paths of life
Then next comes months, weeks and days
Which showed you bright and new ways
To count each minute and each hour
Which you took to reach the happiness tower
And after counting all these endless joys
You'll see taht the basic survival toy
taht you need in your life my dear
Is to banish old doubts and all your fears
And happily move towards th etreasure
And all nice things which bring you pleasure
And show the gift of smile on your face
Which keeps the track and the trace
Of all your joys and all your grief
And explain them all in a brief
And count good days one by one
For reward of a good is to have it done
And you can find joy behind the shadow
Of troubles and pain's tranquil meadow
So if you need life's joy my dear
Then banish old doubts and all your fears.
