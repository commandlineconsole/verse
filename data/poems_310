LOVE
Love is like dream that will never be deleted of the memory,
Love is like wine that leaves you dizzy,
Love is like the sun that burns you,
Love is like the sea that feeds you,
Love is like a book that teaches you,
Love is like a angel that never leaves you,
Love is like sky, have no end,
Love is like God always forgive,
Love is like air, we can not survive without it,
Love is everything and is nothing,
Love is like words, is unforgettable,
Love is have you in me, in my heart, in my soul,
Love is your smile,
Love will exists if you create it.
