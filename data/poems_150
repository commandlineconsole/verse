LOVE IS
Love is a sweet thing
Love can feel like bliss
Love has a scent of flowers
We see hearts everywhere
We hear birds singing
Love is a torturous thing
Love rips the heart in two
We hear a death chant
We feel utter misery
We see unhappiness
Love is annoying and pestering
Love is kind and caring
Love is harsh
Love is gentle
Love is a high price
Love is rewarding
Love is the essence of life
Without it we are lost
'Love conquers all'
'Death does not stop true love'
Love survives
Love follows us to the grave
Love for mother, father, brother, sister
Love for grandmas, grandpas, aunts, uncles
Love for cousins, nephews, nieces
Love for husband, wife, son, daughter
Love for friends, for pets
Love for poor and rich
Love for good and evil
Love for all
Love is precious
All love and are loved
We hold love dear to our hearts
Love Is
