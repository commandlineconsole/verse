END OF POETRY
There will be sadness by and by
The day we let our poetry die
If this should happen to pass
Don’t come to me en mass
This quandary isn’t a fault of mine
I penned words I hoped were fine
You have to look to those who shy
From words that would let them fly
Yet they can’t help but wonder why
The sadness from their heart they cannot pry
Yes sadness steals our wounded souls
But poetry heals and can make us whole
In solemn wonder I beg of you my friend
Please don’t ever let our poetry end
