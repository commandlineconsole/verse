APPEAR THIS WAY
To appear this way returns pleasure,
House this treasure in the gaps
That open up along the way and to this day.
Mighty winds may let us fall from pleasure,
Calling the fairies to do their industry
On the living, on the fair and sane and pleasured.
These common creatures find happiness
Like us, the ones who are proud and efficient
In the ways of men, properties are like dreams.
