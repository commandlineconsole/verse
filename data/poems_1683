FEAR AND PLEASURES AND REWARDS
a clean-shaven man
holding aloft a book
said to me:
I chose this way
so I can go to heaven…
you should too, he added…
a wild-eyed man
displaying much of his revelation
said to me:
if you don’t come this way
you’ll go to hell
to keep the devil company
I laughed and I said:
can one really understand these things
when one has so much
fear and pleasure and gain in one’s head and heart?
leave your fears and pleasures and rewards schemes
and observe what you see
