4.05 FEAR
Fear creates aggressiveness unheedingly,
Fear the most destructive element be,
Fear not natural state of civilized man be,
Yet Fear an emotion crucial for survival be. [1]
Fear on the foundation of worry be,
Fear reinforced by choosing safety,
Fear in the whelm of inadequacy be,
Fear produces one's own ferocity. [2]
Fear's birth in corridors of darkness be,
Silence terrifies people the most clearly,
Fear in the unknown and of future be,
Growing in the shadows of lies fully. [3]
Dispelling fear but knowledge be,
Replacing our doubts completely,
Nothing need be feared undoubtedly,
But must be comprehended absolutely. [4]
Greed by compassion overcome be,
It but asks for sharing unflinchingly,
Fear by kindness triumphant over be,
It calls for gratefulness and love only. [5]
Opposite of ignorance knowledge be,
As unconsciousness to awareness be,
The other side of fear freedom be,
Similarly akin to night as the day be. [6]
Fear dispelled by belief understandingly,
Turn the lights on in darkness knowingly,
Eradicate your fear by living deeply,
With the removal of fear you live only. [7]
Keep your fears to yourself completely,
But share inspiration with others openly,
Weep not for past which unchangeable be,
Fear not the future - live in present only. [8]
Judge your age by the pain you feel,
When in contact with a new idea you be,
Without darkness no birth does be,
As without light nothing flowers surely. [9]
