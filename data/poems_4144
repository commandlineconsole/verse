FEAR
What we fear is nothing but our own fear,
It is so far but yet so near!
Fear makes the fear go severe,
Fear can even make you grab a can of beer!
Fear Is nothing but our own illusion,
Fear creates a hell of confusion!
Fear may even lead you to seclusion,
Fear is manner less and an intrusion!
Its time to bid fear a goodbye,
Its time to rise up in the sky!
I promise not to fear hereby,
And to every failure I shall retry!
