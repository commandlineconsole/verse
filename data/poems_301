MORE THEN LOVING YOU
I love you in the rain
I love you in the sun
I love you heart and soul
For me you are the only one
I love you in the summer
I love you in the spring
I love you in the winter
Because you make my heart sing
I love you every day
I love you every night
I love you all the time
You make my world so right
I love you in good times
I love you in bad times
The only thing that matters
Is that your love is always mine
I love you through all the changes
That you have been through
You see, nothing matters to me
More, then loving you
