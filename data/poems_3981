ABOUT BEING A WOUND-BINDER
Yes, that is my Job In Life!
I am a wound-binder, a woman,
The Care Taker,
The Care Giver,
The one who is always there
When you need her.
I am a member
Of the Sisterhood of Women,
The earth-mothers,
The Comfort Givers,
The ones who are always there
In the long, hard hours of the night.
I am here to care for the children,
To give comfort and aid when needed,
Always here to dry your tears,
And to tell you again
'Everything will be alright.'
I will be here to the end of time,
Telling you how strong you are,
Telling you that 'you can do it! , '
Cheering you onward,
Building your belief in yourself.
Yes, that is the Sisterhood of Women,
The Care Givers,
The Care Takers,
The Wound-Binders...
But who could possibly care for us,
Who could understand,
Except those in the Sisterhood?
