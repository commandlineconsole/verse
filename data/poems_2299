ANGER
Beware of Anger
It is just one letter short of Danger,
Anger present in one's soul
Destructs the body and mind as a whole,
In anger you act foolishly in a fit of rage
Which then creates a very bad image,
Unknowingly you happen to hurt someone
Thereby spoiling all the life's fun,
So do not create place for Anger
In your heart, mind or soul,
For once it settles in you
You are liked by very few,
So try to remain calm & act cool
And do not make yourselves a fool,
You can try this as nothing is impossible
As the word â€˜impossible' itself says I'm possible,
So next time if anger resides in your hearts room
Throw it out & see how your life will bloom!
