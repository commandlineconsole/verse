STOP
Stop trying to help me
Stop worrying about me
Stop putting me in your concern
Stop trying to change me
Stop making me angry
Stop getting on my last nerve
Stop making me worthless
Stop making me hurtless
Stop telling me what I should do
Stop making me feel strain
Stop causing my heart pain
Stop worring about me I'm not you
The mirror has no reflection of me
Of somebody else trying
To live right inside me
I don't know whats gonna happen to me
I'm dissapearing, and don't know what to do
I'm no longer myself, I'm turning into you
I've never wanted to be
The person you're creating
Stop trying to help me
Stop worrying about me
Stop putting me in your concern
Stop trying to change me
Stop making me angry
Stop getting on my last nerve
Stop making me worthless
Stop making me hurtless
Stop telling me what I should do
Stop making me feel strain
Stop causing my heart pain
Stop worring about me I'm not you
You can't be living your heart through me
The beating is crazy
Blocking out my own
I don't want you pressuring me
What can't you see
I just want to be left alone
I'm dissapearing, and don't know what to do
I'm no longer myself, I'm turning into you
I've never wanted to be
The person you're creating
Stop trying to help me
Stop worrying about me
Stop putting me in your concern
Stop trying to change me
Stop making me angry
Stop getting on my last nerve
Stop making me worthless
Stop making me hurtless
Stop telling me what I should do
Stop making me feel strain
Stop causing my heart pain
Stop worring about me I'm not you
I can't breathe
I need some room
I can't move
I can't go on being you
I can't take it
I can't make it
I can't deal with this
You're driving me up the wall
I can't fake it, I can't face it
Afraid I'm gonna fall
You don't know
How hard it is
You don't know
How long I've felt like this
You don't know
Who I am no more
You don't know
The things I've held instore
You don't know
Because I don't know
How much further I can go
I'm fadding
Better save me
Before I'm fully out of here
You can't blame me
I'm just making
You proud so you coud care
I'm dissapearing, and don't know what to do
I'm no longer myself, I'm turning into you
I've never wanted to be
The person you're creating
Stop trying to help me
Stop worrying about me
Stop putting me in your concern
Stop trying to change me
Stop making me angry
Stop getting on my last nerve
Stop making me worthless
Stop making me hurtless
Stop telling me what I should do
Stop making me feel strain
Stop causing my heart pain
Stop worring about me I'm not you
