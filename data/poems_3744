CARING
I'm all alone,
No one cares,
I'm an outcast,
Even in my own family,
I don't care.
My life is hell,
My family doesn't care.
I want to die,
My friend's don't care.
Why do I care,
When no one else does?
What must I do,
To stop caring,
About myself and others?
How do I hide,
The pain I feel,
When I know no one cares?
What does care mean?
And when will people start caring?
