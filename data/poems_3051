TRIBULATONS
We shall one day overcome
In the adversity of this live
Where pains and grieve is found
Trials and fear being face
Dimly in fear and sorrows
Panicking and sobbing of happenings
Restlessness and discomfort everywhere
The uncertainty of this life is being dispel
Meekly waiting for a revolution
Taking comfort from formal smile
Seems some how hard
Cos trial is an experiment upon a man
Proving the value and strength of his faith
People anticipating trouble and managing
To enjoy many sorrows that never
Really happen to them
But thou the sorrow last for a night,
Joy cometh thus in the morning
