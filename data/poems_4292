FEAR TO FAILURE
Holding a pen
I gonna to write something
Some questions which come across in my mind
Why I can't built myself further
Why I can't strong myself further
Why I can't dare to fulfill my dream
Is there something which pushes me back?
Is it the fear of my failure?
It is a silent threat, not heard only felt
like the storm you see quietly but forcefully
While everyone has hopes and dreams
And wants everything that is gold.
At the same time I fear to say something about my dream
Is there the fear of my failure?
Which push me back further

While everybody wants to touch the sky
That's why they are jumping, jumping off the ground
At the same time I really all terrified to fly.
Is there the fear of my failure?
Which push me back further
While we all develop an aspiration,
and say we are determined, resilient,
At the same time I fear to determine anything
Is there the fear of my failure?
Which push me back further
Many of us shy away with hesitation
that Fear of failure is a fear malevolent.
