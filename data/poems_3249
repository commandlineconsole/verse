GENTLY THROUGH THE NIGHT
Past the memories and the silent sorrows
I must bury within the core of my soul,
I speak only of the beauty of the day
The evanescent peace of mind
From a momentary lightness
Of the heart from a word,
A whisper, a murmur
Barely expressed
Scarcely heard,
A quiet protest
A stifled sigh
A passing glance
Seeking a kindred spirit
Towards an unseen horizon
A beacon searching  hidden corners
Of curtains providing temporary shelter
For thoughts escaped from a vigilant being
Watching over the brood entrusted to a loyal friend;
Gently uncoiling the reams of sorrow within my soul
The memories, the smiles, and release them to the wind.
