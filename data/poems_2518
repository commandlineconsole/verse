THE SELFISHNESS CONSUMES THE GOOD
The selfishness consumes the good
The good consumes the want to not be
The want to not be provokes the anger
The anger trips me into swagger
The swagger lands me at the 7-11
The 7-11 finds me buying many beers
The many beers find me swirling my thoughts
The swirled thoughts grow into a maelstrom
The maelstrom becomes the deluge
The deluge wrecks the ship
The shipwreck crashes into the morning
The morning wakes me wince
The wincing makes me seem bitter
The bitterness makes me stash the goodness
The stashing of goodness appears to be selfishness
The selfishness consumes the goodâ€¦.
