NOT A QUITTER
Days of wounded
Days of crying
Days of angriness
Broke me down to million little pieces
Will I ever be a whole again?
Days of hoping
Days of struggling
Days of disappointment
Sucked me off till the last dropp of my belief
Will I ever believe in others again?
Days of ignorance
Days of selfishness
Days of my own
Covered me up from fear of being loved
Will I ever dare enough to feel that care again?
Days of mending
Days of trying
Days of preserving
Tear me down thousand times, can’t share what I feel
Will I still have a chance to treasure what still remains?
Life ends when I stop dreaming
Hope ends when I stop believing
Love ends when I stop caring
Friendship ends when I stop sharing
Will I loose everything when I stop?
Do I have time to rest just for a while?
Just a short time
Just a little break
Just a temporary slowdown
I am not a quitter … I will finish what I’ve done
