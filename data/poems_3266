AFRICA
If there is life after death-
O God! Let me take birth in Africa.
Country of death and dry, worn out, violent and hard plays
The eye of wild beast destroying of human life, child's future
Man is being defeated by man
Belief, trust and promise is also being defeated
Man is for man's sake-This is as proverb.
If there is life after death-
O God! Let me take birth in Africa.
As I can flare up with sun song
The exhausted with sorrowfulness worn out men
Hey ever deprived, come to know that I am with you
I am copper colored man of greenly golden
Will stand against of all perished?
If there is life after death-
O God! Let me take birth in Africa.
