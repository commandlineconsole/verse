OPEN ADVICE
Golden advice from lord
Not to utter simple word
If found not necessary
That shall be piece of advice from so many
The situation has become complex
People want no advice and relax
They think of superfluous nature
Where they have right to shape future
Right or wrong does not concern
They want only happy turn
The means and ways concern less
They want others to feel tense
Under such environment
It is better not to pass comment
Keep quiet and observe with silence
Just keep eyes open with simple presence
No one may lament your quietness
They would rather appreciate on face
“You did right thing by not meddling”
Such praise may come with smiling
So you are taken as unwanted
With simple reason it is related
”Keep hands of with no interference”
Such may be open advice to us at once
