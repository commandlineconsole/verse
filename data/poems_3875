PROTECTOR
Protector I risk my life
Protector I fight for a right
Protector My right is her
Protector Her life is valued
Protector Ill never give up
Protector Until i die
Protector Ill risk it all
Protector All for her
Protector You can't change my mind
Protector Until the end of time
Protector Always saving her
Protector But does she care
: (
Protector I don't care
Protector She is my light
Protector Even if she dosn't care
Protector I care
Protector I gave my heart
Protector She held it tight
Protector Die today from heart break
