PLEASURE
It's a feeling that brings pleasure
It's a feeling that causes happiness
That is why I think it is
A gift of God and a bliss
For it shows warmth and love
For those for whom we care
And those who are really
Very close and our dear
It's a thing that brings pleasure
And lots of warmth and cheer
And gives us chance to show
Our loved ones love and care
And I think nothing can
Be equal to this pleasure
That God has given to us
To enjoy in the leisure.
