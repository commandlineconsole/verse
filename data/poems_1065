GIVE ME THE TASTE,
give me the taste,
give me the taste,
the joy of being with you,
you made me see beauty of you,
Iam not under attack anymore,
I loved that face,
I can see that great taste,
give me love,
more love than these,
alive and living,
we will survive,
we will live and never die,
I can watch them seeing me,
This is the face of a King,
Within me is the living man,
Man that is living,
My human will is not to attack,
But to love the human ability,
Make me perceive the joy of living,
Do not make me be under attack,
Make me see the joy of us loving one another,
By human conscience,
It is my ability to see the fear dyeing,
We are all the lovers of the higher being,
Perceive the joy of living,
That by the grace we are never willing to die,
Time is moving so fast,
All our abilities is to love one another,
All our abilities is to perceive the glorious throne.
