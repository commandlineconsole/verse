SADNESS
Do you remember the days when all was good and you were happy
Well thoughs days are gone now
Lost forever in this vast world
Do you remember the time when you got in a fight with your mum
Boy, you experienced sadness then
Do you remember the day your dad sent you to your room because you were bad
Well, that was a bad day and you remember the sadness that came after that
Do you remember the day your marks dipped and you got yelled at
You were very familiar with sadness
You felt like nobody cared about you, like you could walk off and nobody would notice
that whenever you did something wrong, you would see the bad
but never see the good,
day by day and  week by week
Well the days went by and you saw no good and was lost in your depression and sadness
All at once you felt the world going against you and no one even noticed your depression
All you could think of was “wouldn’t it be great to have another life”
And sometimes you were right but other times you got along alright and sadness was forgotten for the time being
But a moment later it was remembered and all that happiness was drifting away and left you with, once again, sadness and depression
And your life is once again in sadness and misery
That sadness is a bad sadness and one that is not going away soon
unless you do something soon it will be like a cloud drifting over your head and will remain there
forever and ever
