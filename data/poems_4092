MOTHER THERESA'S 'POEZIA'
Release me, oh God,
From the desire to be adored,
From the desire to be exalted,
From the desire to be honored,
From the desire to be applauded,
From the desire to be ranked
From the desire to be sought after for advice,
From the desire to be commended,
From the desire to be famous,
From the fear of being disdained,
From the fear of being disparaged
From the fear of being denounced
From the fear of being repellent
From the fear of being forgotten
From fear of collapsing under dishonesties.
From the fear of being mocked,
From the fear of being suspicioned!
Amen.
