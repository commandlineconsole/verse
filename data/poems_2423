ONE BODY TWO MINDS NO SOUL
Two different worlds two different times two different hearts make two different minds
There never gonna be the same while one can see the other is standing blind
While the one is aware the other you wont see its so lost in fear its to hard to find
When one comes out with the anger the other will sit back and unwind
When anger is gone the other lets the whole world see it and lets me shine
Its not a split personalty its just me wishing i could forget this and rewind
Go back to the times when  life was so simple may the first 1989
Only one year old all i ever wanted was you to keep me safe keep me hold
For as long as i can remember i had to keep going or give in and fold
From the age of a child my anger wasn't mild up until now my angers still wild
I still scream at the world give me what you got because my heart cant be told
