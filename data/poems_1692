A LOVER'S DREAM
When sweet sleep robs me of my conscience
When love beckons out loud and deigns to allay my fears
When pain is but a distant memory
And pleasure the moment’s pleasure
When my heart rings with her heart’s name
And my soul’s soul sings my lover’s fame
I know for sure I’m only dreaming
And in destiny’s brass my lover’s dream shall for all eternity be cast
