LIKE A STREAM
Like a stream that flows
all of life passes by
and the tears of joy
and the tears of pain
shall not pass this way again
So I pause - for a moment in time
to sense the world around me
This moment - is going
and these Joys and Pains
will not pass this way again
But somewhere around the bend
New joys are waiting to be felt
and the pains - who knows when
are sure to pass this way again.
