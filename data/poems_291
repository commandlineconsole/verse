LOVE CAN
Love is grand, love is fine
Love is with us all the time
Love will start then love will grow
Where it begins we'll never know
Love can fade, love can die
Love can make you just sigh
Love can come and slowly grow
Love for all we should show
Love can conquer, love can destroy
Love is used by some like a toy
Love can burn and hurt so bad
Love can make you very sad
Love can grow and shine so bright
Love can get you through the night
Love can drive you to the brink
Broken love can drive you to drink
Loves emotions are so plenty
Loves benifits are so many
Love can last for a lifetime
That's the love I wish was mine
