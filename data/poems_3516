A WORLD FULL OF PEOPLE
People have poisoned this world.
Every single one is selfish
And impossible to satisfy.
All care about nothing but themselves
And their concerns.
The mind can only fool the heart for so long.
Feelings concerning others fade fast
As the shallowness of affection, pity and other such emotions,
Eats away at their effects.
Language, our imperfect expression of thought,
Is constantly uttered without a thought to its importance
Or uselessness.
Unnecessary speech polutes the air
And I wish I were alone, truly alone;
The last person on this rotting planet.
