OUR GREATEST FEAR
it walks with us in the day
it sleeps with us in the night
it darkened your inner soul
it takes over your body with controlled
it hate you down to your bone
it scares you till the morning glows
it will never stop fight you until you let go
it will always be there  till you dropp on your toes
for fears have no flesh
but it scares us always
fear have no eyes it can't see us
fear have no weapon it cannot shoot us
fear have no power it can't overcome us
don't let this thing called fear beat you like that
why worried kick the hell out of fear
