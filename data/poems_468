SATIN SHEETS
They lay upon the satin sheets
Entwined in each other's bliss
She rested her weary head
Upon his heaving chest
She smiled contentedly as they held each other close
As they recalled last night's love of bliss
An inferno of passion and ecstasy and bliss
A lover's wonderful moment in time
The heat of the moment was like a burning ember flame
As they stroked the burning passion that lingered
In their moment of passion their moment of love
He leans forwards softly and whispers in her ear
Thou art my true love will you forever be mine
With a hunger and burning need she sighed with ecstasy
Yes my love I'm yours for eternity
