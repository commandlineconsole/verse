SONNET: THE WORLD’S UNFORTUNATE
Who cares about the flowers in the wild,
That Nature brings forth, perfuming landscape?
Who cares about the orphaned and street-child,
That world won’t free nor help to just escape?
Who cares about the innocent blood spilled
By terrorist-attacks and accidents?
Who cares about the men on frontier killed,
By land-mines, blasts, mortar sounds that air rent?
Who cares about the beggar/prostitute,
Who has no other way of livelihood?
Who cares about the old-aged, destitute?
Who are dependent on others for food!

Who cares about the men unfortunate?
’Tis God who can their hardships mitigate!
