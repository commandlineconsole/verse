AFRAID
My worst fear
Is not a person
Or a thing
My worst fear is me
My thoughts and feelings
My hopes and dreams
They are inside of me,
A part of me
But they are my fears
Fears of what can’t be
Of what will be
Fears of my thoughts voicing themselves
At the wrong time
The wrong place
With the wrong people
Fears of letting my feelings out
Exposing them for others to see
Being vulnerable, open
My hopes and dreams that won’t ever be
I fear making the wrong choices
Choosing the wrong path
Not being able to help those dear to me
My worst nightmare
My own weakness showing
My strength betraying me
And others paying the price
My worst fear isn’t anything or anyone
My worst fear is me.
