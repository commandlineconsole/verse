TRUST
There are many times in life as I wonder,
And I feel God's protection ever near,
I will never forget the times He has warned me,
So gently, never alraming, He is love.
Satan wants me to be afraid, He wants me to fear,
Ever human, I've made mistakes and I do fear,
Then the tender loving Master says, 'I love you',
Lean on Me, have no fear, I am love.
Then He gently, oh so gently surrounds me,
With compansion, I feel His perfect peace,
In my small and fragile state, He is with me,
I am strong, I have no fear, He is love.
There is a difference now in my life,
Jesus fills me with His love and abiding peace,
I want to stay close by his side and never fear,
Never fear, never fear, for God is love.
I know Jesus will always be there,
I love Him so, oh how I need Him in my life,
He enriches and fulfills my every need,
Remember, Jesus is the conqueror over fear.
