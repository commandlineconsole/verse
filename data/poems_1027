MASK.. (MY HEART.. / MY FACE..)
In my heart
the problems are now hiding
Just a matter of time and time is fading
Pain and struggles I succeeded to confine
Only allowed to pile giving it permission to forever be mine
Suppressed and undisturbed
Taken for granted and misunderstood
In my face
a thoughfull smile for all to see
Just a matter of joy and joy I have plenty
Laughter and happyness I succeeded to embrace
Only to show the joy with a smile on my face
Freely and out in the open
Taken for granted and misunderstood
