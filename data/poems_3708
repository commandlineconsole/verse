DOES ANY ONE CARE?
Does any one care about me?
Does any one care about the world
We live in?
Does any one care about their fate?
Does any one care about the climate change that
Is happening all over the world?
Does any one care about the high cost of living
That we are facing each year?
Does any one care about religion?
Does any one care about being respected by others?
