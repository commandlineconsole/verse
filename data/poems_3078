SORROW VERSUS REVENGE...JUSTIFY
Sorrow. Strange word. Six tiny letters....
Murmured by murderers. Priests.
A word bled from lips. Eyes. hands.
Dry sand raging hearts. Doubt. Decision.
False. Steadfast. Indecisive.
What sword drips sorrow, slicing freedom
For nations?
What nation oozes sorrow, being lifted
From despots?
What joyous revels bought in blood.
Sorrow. Sorry.
Boudicea, daughters raped, raged
Tribes to war. Romans' blood-bath.
Revenge by sorrow.
Lakota Sioux, Red Cloud's curse remembered,
Left one pony alive. Custer...sorry?
Revenge by sorrow.
Can sorrow separate from blood...mental. Physical
Storms of years. Judged. Betrayed.
In seconds, we create
Eons.
Sorrow.
