SWEET ONE
Have you ever been awakened by a lovers touch
Caressing the places that you desire so much
Pleasuring your senses to the next degree
Allowing your most erotic dreams set free
Its intensity so strong you quiver and shake
With a desire to go further your senses ache
Your climax is coming but you don’t know when
As another level of pleasure you find yet again
You bite at your lips your senses on fire
As your lovers actions take you ever so higher
Your whole body shudders as you reach your peak
Now to end this dream its me that you seek.
“closing thought”
Passions inflamed sets a soul on fire
Sensualities fulfillment our greatest desire
