ECSTASY
Shout with pleasure
Scream with pain
Enter the world where ecstasy meets insane
Gates are open to welcome in
Strangers of loneliness
Baptized in sin
Wicked children come out to play
Gates closed
Now they stay in this pleasure world
Shared by those who understand true sane
This is where they will scream with pain.
