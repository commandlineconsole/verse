MID DAY TEARS...FOR YOU DEAR MA
I seek comfort in your presence
in all the little things that we enjoyed together
Little did I know that it is your absence
that is binding me together
to our joys...
Simplicity & Innocence lent you your charm
In life and strife you have been my balm (your soothing presence in everything)
And all the these little things that you have passed on to me
are what keeping me free
from life..
As realization dawns
Joy mingles with sorrow
I realize that what I have been feeling (and continue to seek)  is not joy after all
Joy in isolation?
Numb...
Planted a tree
And never watched it grow
the tree yearns for it's caretaker
Though it knows it will never find her
Again....
