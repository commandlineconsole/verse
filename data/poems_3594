DEATH
Death
is everywhere
but what concerns me of course
is that he's breathing
down my neck
always there to remind me
that in this world
everything must go
i can feel him when I'm sad
and i can feel him when i'm joyful
i can feel him when i play with my kids
and when i enjoy with my wife
i can feel him when i walk down the street
and in the generous spring breeze
and in the summer rain
and in the laughter of lovers in the street
and in the sitcoms on TV
i can feel his matter-of-fact
in the schools and in hospitals
at the counters of supermarkets
he knows our time has been measured
since the moment we were born
and he's there doing his job
like all other decent men
i can feel him when they scorn me
and i can feel him when i'm praised
sometimes i really kinda feel pressed for time
knowing that it's so short
trapped in this prison
his word is last
but then it begins again
only not too many know this
well he's not an enemy
though not much of a friend either
everything crumbles under his touch
but it's not his fault
it's the purpose of this world
i'd rather have death teach me about life
than some dishonest people
posing as friends
i cannot bear their false grins anymore
i pray for strength
to be able to keep this pace
it's really too fast sometimes
in this endless rant
i hope for catharsis
i pray for salvation
i despair for love
i'm glad i finally know what i want
