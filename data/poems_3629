THEIR EYES OPEN
Brightness of solar smirking
Encourages fruitful activity
Men look for money
Women for love
Their eyes open
Few hours ago
The bed was kept warm
Groggy balls
Looked wonderous
In strange states
Chasing summary delusions
Seeing events with eyes closed
Now the bustle
At last concerns them
Ambition speeds on
The clock on the mantlepiece
Keeps their eyes open.
