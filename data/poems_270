MY LOVE
my love, my love
is this love
you beat me black and blue
you cliped my wings so icant fly
my love, my love
is this love
i crouch in my dark room
waiting to see some light
my love, my love
i express my love, by giving my heart to you
my love, my love you express your love by using your fists
my love, my love is this what they call love
