THE DEEP RED DRINK POT
Only a deep red drink pot is
my life partner
I have no wealth
no home
and no homestead.
I am a free man
free from country
family and society.
I have forgotten
Who was my mom
or my dad
I am the second Adam
on this earth
I am in hell
and shall return to hell.
I have a God
who does not care for me
And I do not care for Him
I care for this drink pot
and it cares for me.
