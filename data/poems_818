AN ADMONITION
Don't live your life in fear
Of dread calamity
There's much joy for you here
Instead be of good cheer
And this will set you free
Don't live your life in fear
The way ahead is clear
Attention is the key
There's much joy for you here
Great beauty will appear
All those who seek will see
Don't live your life in fear
No need to shed a tear
No need for self-pity
There's much joy for you here
Your happiness is near
It's who you're meant to be
Don't live you life in fear
There's much joy for you here
