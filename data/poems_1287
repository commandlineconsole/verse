HINTS AND IMAGES
Long low sensual sighs
Rich gnawed plum delights
slow soft peeled back skin
Raw tension in the air begins
entwining lying in the rain
Fractal images be-spokes
melting a soft melodic refrain
Bright echoes from a funeral
train
Lost in blizzards
Of melting stars colliding cinnabar
filled light mars the hints of
secret delight
Button noses
the wink of an eye
The not so subtle slice
of warm and soft dark thigh
A shard of lemon
Against a shard of blue sky
and a soft warm tender kiss
healing a broken hear-ted tear... goodbye x
