THE REVENGE OF LOVE
Oh! Rukmoni, are you listening?
How can you listen!
As you are living  in a far away  land
By chance if you  listen this poem
In the sky or air, take it for granted
That it has been written
For you and  if you have time to spare
Go to the silent bank of the river
Or listen to it closed door ever.
Oh! Rukmoni,
I have taken the revenge
Not against you
But against me,
The job why I had not got
In the proper time why I had not.
So when I was breaking the steps
Of the heart of yours
And the houses and the doors.
The steps were trembling
The stars of the sky were whirling
In a fear as if  the  things might  go in a wrong way
Your parents would come out and  say
That it would not be possible for them  to keep the promise at all
Though to me they would be extremely polite  humble.
Suddenly all the hopes would get their  wings
Flying  like a thread less  kite all the dreams.
The job I have got today
And beg to you to pardon me
Why in the proper time I did not!
So you are away from me …apart
Still I feel you in the corner of my heart
And in my every dropp of blood red
And in the every soft touch of the wind.
Just remembering the name of you
I get an immense pleasure in the world of dream
Like a white cloud floating in the paradise
When I am in the ocean of sorrow of my life.
So many brides I have seen
So many brides I have been  shown
I have rejected  them all
Saying ‘'I am very well alone''
They will not feel the stone
They will not feel the feather
Of my heart and soul
Which I feel lying alone
Looking at the doors of my dream
Tearing down of all the bondage
My love is coming….!
Even though living in the reality
I don't understand why
This is not a truth, it's a lie.
In the multitudes
I am alone and bitterly lonely
With a delirium mind and a heart full of pangs and agony
The eyes are in the sky, I walk down the road
And in my imagination I draw your face in the cloud
Who are sometimes laughing!
Who are sometimes crying!
What is that to me?
Even you are away from me
I got you in the clouds of imagination
In every pose and in every position
Just like that, come to me
And sit down to say sweet or sad story
I promise, I shall not end the journey.
To make me  forget your memories
The virtual road ends in my house
I could not do anything but to stand up
In the wall of your picture to draw up
Which sometimes crying!
Which sometimes laughing!
Playing the flute of the dolorous
The nectar of my heart glorious
She talks with me like a mad woman
And saying that I became a mad man.
