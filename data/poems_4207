FEAR
It captures your mind and weakens your strength
It’s hard to fight the feelings and illusions
It swallows your mind until you have nothing left
Fear
It wants to haunt you
It wants to weaken you
Most of all it wants to over power you
Fear
You want to run but it follows
You want to win but it’s impossible
Fear is just too strong
Fear
Everyone has fears
And it’s never good to tell them
Remember that fear is dangerous
