REBIRTH
The great reawakening of my being
Is out for self rediscovering
I will revive my strength within
To renew the inner me
I repudiate the thoughts of failure
Cos the resounding sound of victory is so refreshing

I need to recreate my thinking
By rejuvenating my self worth
As I see the pressing need to rebound
From the depth of depression
Let me take the bold step of faith
Cos the joy of rebirth cannot be replaced

A new day lifts and rekindles the weakened soul
Who can stop the revamp in our lives
That the rekindling sun brings
Such like the joy of a new born baby
Though laborious but puts smiles on the motherâ€™s face
Same unspeakable joy of rebirth I long to experience daily
