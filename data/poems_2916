THE BALLAD OF MR.SORROW & MS.JOY
In the porch of a building
Under the bright lamp
They hugged each other wistfully
After several years
never met in one self
The one was named Ms.Joy
Others named Mr.Sorrow
Ms.Joy always likes green color
Mr.Sorrow likes black color
Sometimes Ms.Joy far too long left Mr.Sorrow alone
But Mr.Sorrow is unhappy when Ms.Joy alone
Ms.Joy is fear to  Mr.Sorrow
Instead of Mr.Sorrow was sad when Ms.Joy went  alone
So Mr.Sorrow is always looking to Ms.Joy
Although Ms.Joy is shame if Mr.Sorrow come together
But she thought also when Mr.Sorrow not bother her with phone
'Be mistaken for the actual game'
Ms.Joy is always away
Mr.Sorrow  is  always missed her
Pedaling lonely in a crowd
So it's very rare, together moments like this
Ms.Joy be hugged and kissed by Mr.Sorrow
And Ms.Joy felt silently
'What I'm arrogant' think Mr.Sorrow
'Why did she isn't just created for me alone'
But Ms.Joy still isn't  pleased when Mr.Sorrow near to her
Ms.Joy better stay away
In the celebration of fireworks
She was a high-profile year-round excitement
As if Mr.Sorrow can already be forgotten
She met a lot of people
She talked with a lots of smiles
She kissed the left cheek and right as the cosmopolitan people
She didn't think anything except have fun-fun-fun-fun and festivities
She didn't think anymore about Mr.Sorrow
But suddenly a poor heavy rain came
All scuttled looking for the porch
Somehow it came on Ms.Joy
And suddenly Mr.Sorrow already hugged her
