THERE IS NO STOPPING JOY
THERE IS NO STOPPING JOY

There is no stopping joy
From the heart that overflows
Filled with love of the Father
It lets the whole world know
There is a Redeemer
Who loves to the uttermost
Indwells each true believer
TRUE joy of the Holy Ghost

That joy lives on forever
Right into eternity
Where then it will take wings and fly
Singing with the Almighty
O Hallelujah brother
Sister raise your voice
Our God is an awesome God
Praise God He is our Choice
