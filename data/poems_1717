SIMPLE PLEASURES
Simple in appearance
Subtle in design
The framework of a friendship
That ages like fine wine
It is the simple pleasures
That makes it all worthwhile
Sometimes just a sunrise
Is enough to make me smile
So much is in the watching
Or listening to nature’s voice
And knowing when to stop
And realize you have a choice
Take some time to just step back
And just take in the view
It’s about the simple pleasures
That all of us once knew
