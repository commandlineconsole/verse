SURPRISE, SURPRISE
Surprise, surprise!
Surprise is such an ambiguous thing
Never are we sure what a surprise brings
Surprises them selves may be large or small
There are good ones and bad ones for us all
Surprise can be shocking and some we welcome
Some people don’t like them others love them
It is the unknown the intrigue of the surprises
Along with the fact that they come in all sizes
Surprise can drain us when sad news it brings
Sometimes it brings pleasure no bigger than rings
Surprises need not even be material things
Surprises can elate us make us feel like kings
Surprise could be news of upcoming new birth
Or of trinkets and treasures of variable worth
Contact from an old friend from long ago
Waking in morning finding ten inches of snow
Surprise may come from finding something lost
Or sticker shock at what the new car will cost
Surprises appear to us all in various ways
In thrilling movies, books and even plays
Surprise can even come trying on clothes
Hopefully finding you can still fit those
Maybe when breaking out winter’s coat
Finding in the pocket a ten dollar note
Surprise can happen at any time day or night
It need not be Halloween that gives you a fright
Opening a door to discover what’s there
That unsure moment when you trip on a stair
Surprise can be gentle many learn peek-a-boo
The look of the child when it sees it’ you
Some seem to happen even against our will
Have you hesitated to open up that bill?
Surprises when pleasant of course are best
Bad ones and sad put pains in my chest
It should be no surprise my wish for you
All your surprises be pleasant ones….BOO
