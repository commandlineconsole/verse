SORROW, WHERE ARE YOU?
If you are in reality
Come to me
I will swim along with your tide
And dissolve into your salty water
If there is no joy
Sorrow, where are you?
Come to me
If you are in reality
I will dance with your beat
And sing in your tune
If there is no joy
Sorrow, where are you?
Come to me
I will ride on your golden wings
And challenge the sun
Sorrow, where are you?
Come to me
I want to end my misery
By singing  a song of you.
