MY SADNESS CAME OVER ME AGAIN
MY SADNESS CAME OVER ME AGAIN
My sadness came over me again
Why? What is it all for? What does it mean?
How can I possibly know?
It is all so much greater than I am.
I am so so so small so small
I will never understand.
Even the Darkness must have more light than I do
Even the Night more Light than I can dream.
