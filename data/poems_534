ARMAGEDDON
Sharing a sampler of Love's fruit,
Junes and moons and stolen kisses
We know grand passion and deal in high romance
High drama, Armageddon of the heart.
Junes and Moons and stolen kisses,
Dessert before a meal of sorrow.
High drama, Armageddon of the heart -
History repeating; always a surprise.
Dessert before a meal of sorrow
Sweet, sticky passions piled high
History repeating - always a surprise.
We are players, ever changing masks.
Sweet, sticky passions piled high
We feed each other and gorge again
We are players, ever changing masks.
We reel, stagger and purge the glut.
We feed each other and gorge again
Never remembering our last awful meal.
We reel, stagger and purge the glut
And emptied, sit alone with deadened hearts.
Never remembering our last awful meal.
We know grand passion and deal in high romance
And emptied, sit alone with deadened hearts,
Sharing a sampler of Love's fruit.
