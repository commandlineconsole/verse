MY PASSION
Writing is my passion
My way of showing feelings
Coming straight from the heart
And sends my world a-reeling
These are words I cannot speak
Yet with my pen they flow
Every word is special
And as big as a billow
Sad words, glad words
And some in between
Gives my heart the comfort
While sipping my caffeine!
My passion is to make you feel
As if you were really there
Be it beside my mama
Or washing dinnerware -
Want you to feel every word
‘Cause they are written just for you
Just have that knack to write this
So you’d wonder, could it be true?
