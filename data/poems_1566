SEEK
Brought on by the ever present need to be loved,
We destroy all that is loveable in us.
Brought on by the pursuit of pleasure,
We destroy all of the pleasure around us.
Brought on by the need to be needed,
We destroy those who need us.
By are desires we are defined,
And by those desires we are destroyed.
We seek the light,
We find the dark.
We reach for hope,
We rush headlong into hopelessness.
Find the pleasure,
But give pleasure in return.
Find the need,
But give to those who need.
Find the love,
But give the love without conditions.
Seek the light,
Reach for hope,
Find the love.
