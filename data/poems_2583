SADNESS IS
sadness is seeing black roses
that are old and withered
it sounds like a dying cat
that won't give up
sadness taste like rotten apples
that make your stomach churn
sadness feels like a stab to the stomach
that doctors can't fix
it smells like a damp dark basement
that won't come clean
sadness is as colorful as the rainbow
and as hard to find
