THE PAIN, THE ANGUISH, THE FEAR
Inside of me
raining down
its everywhere
hurting me
blinding me
to myself
the pain, the anguish, the fear
they smother me
blocking out all thought
breeding misery
my only will
is to end it all
to stop the pain
the anguish, the fear
of them
I live afraid
of their next move
out of fear
I build a wall
to block myself
from them
I give everyone the illusion
of being inside but it is only
smoke and mirrors
sometimes fooling myself
into thinking it as well
the pain, the anguish, the fear
seep through the cracks
smother me
in a blanket of hate, anger and fear
they are killing me
slowly but surely
the pain, the anguish, the fear
