SEARCH FOR PLEASURE
I went to the Everest summit,
I went down to the bottom of the sea,
I went even to the extreme end of the Earth,
But could not find the pleasure I desired.
I worked at the administrator in vain,
Working as a slave too went to vain,
Even sailor job didn’t paid me,
I thought of carpenter’s one that too didn’t helped me.
I decided to be gone to extreme cruelty,
But could find no pleasure there too,
I worked for the charity too,
But could not my search pleasure there too.
I went to great persons and also to god,
No one could satisfy me what I was looking for,
Now I have come to you for the same thing,
Will I get pleasure in your home too.
