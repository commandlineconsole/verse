PURPLE AND WHITE
Purple swirls with white and becomes lavender.
Lavender, reminds my senses of my beloved grandmother.
Grandmother, with paper thin skin that is soft as roses.
A rose, itâ€™s sweet smelling aroma is candy for my nose.
My nose, one of my finest features that fills with me delight.
Delight, fine noses, sweet roses, soft grandmothers and purple swirled with white.
