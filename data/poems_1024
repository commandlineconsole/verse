ODE
Poets of joy, poets of pain
let your echoing words remain
among the living and breathing souls.
Don't let them die in the burning coals
and turn into ashes with every refrain
lost forever in a world insane.
Poets of joy, poets of pain
shall you find your words in heaven again?
Will the angels sing them in musical form?
Will there be no rain or thundering storm
to destroy the feelings of joy and pain
that were present in that world insane?
