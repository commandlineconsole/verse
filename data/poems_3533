NO GOODBYES ARE FOREVER.
They are the only one in sight,
As you make your way through the angry night,
Their eyes locked on yours,
Then at your feet, covered in sores,
Concern and worry fills their once lustful eyes,
As they think of all the other sores, after all the other goodbyes,
You thought after so much pain you'd learn,
You thought you'd learn to not let yourself feel concern,
But walking down this road is all you know,
Walking back to happiness and away from sorrow,
The feeling of lust back in your heart,
Only stronger now since you were apart,
You feel it burn deep inside,
Making your heart stretch far and wide,
The love you see, and the love you feel,
Is the only love you've ever know to be truly real,
The sorrows and the cries,
Mean nothing, neither do our goodbyes,
Goodbyes aren't forever,
We, baby, will always be together,
We are like the titanic, but only better,
For we will stay afloat, where the others drowned and got wetter,
We shall stand on the deck with our sore covered feet,
As we tell the story to our grandchildren of how we beat,
We beat the 'goodbyes are forever',
Because we husband, we are still together.
