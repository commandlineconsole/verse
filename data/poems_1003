JOY AN ILLUSION...
Joy an illusion...
Nothing in life seems to be fun,
Nothing in life seems to be joy,
Its always those ifs and but’s
Which pop up and create troubles,
No matter how much you try,
Happiness is a resource which is scarce everywhere,
No matter how much you attempt,
Failure always precedes success,
The joy is an illusion to which, there is no end and its just life,
That has too many bends
You never know which way you turn,
But the grass that appears greener on the other side never turns to be true…
