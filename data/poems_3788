YOUR CARE
YOUR CARE
Your care is like the fresh smelling breeze of SEPTEMBER
Under a moonlite night spilling out it's sweet frangrance after the close of twi-light.
Your care hangs majestically like AUGUST clouds, speaking quietly in urgency to a pure love in a heart that listen for the answer of CHRIST,
Your care shines like the sun of JULY, heating my oyster outer hardness to soften my now exposed hidden pearls and only the month of JUNE MAY remember the unfold of your gleam, like APRIL'S harvesting buds,
Your care is unpredictable like MARCH but breathes gentleness like the wisper of wind in your ear, echoing a sign of peace,
Your care is black like the history of FEBRUARY, memorable to celebrate once, all the time,
For all the time you freed the dumb,
all the time you sparked like the strokes of lightnen, to reflect change in the face of adversity,
Your care is asunder [apart], humbling like the month of JANUARY, gracing your surroundings like a doctor bird, meek.
Your care is sweet like salt fish and ackee in the mouth of JAMAICA, representing beauty like the blue mahoe!
OCTOBER is when i left.
