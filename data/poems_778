RECIPE OF JOY
Open your eyes with joy in them
For joys and happiness always hem
Your day with the stitches of hope
And protects you from being in mope
And spend your noon with smiles
For smile shares your trouble's pile
And returns to shine on you
And brings with it fain that is true
And when hours of evening start
Then try to practice your learnt art
And come forward to occupy joy's seat
For happiness works on busy feet
And lastly throughout the night
Dream of things that are bright
For it will finally end on a pray
With the recipe of joy for your day.
