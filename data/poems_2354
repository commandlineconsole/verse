THE STRESS.
All the stress is gone
Now all I have is the anger
All the anger from her
The same anger that comes everyday
All the pain
All the fighting
All the annoyance
Basicly everything but fun
Can't live this way
Sence she wont stop
Then theres only 2 ways to stop it all
So hopefuly for them I will have to say...
Theres gonna be a tomorrow
