THE GRUDGE
The Grudge
I linger in the past
not concerned for the future
and not awake in my present
My actions are fast
no thought in consequences
nor what happens next
This grudge consumes me
a bitter taste for you
but my vengeance is pleasure
to hear your painful shrieks
from all that i'll do
will just get better and better
Lock your door
that won't keep me away
I'll break in within seconds
no creak in the floor
as i'm closer to play
with a flawless entrance
.. you can't escape this..
