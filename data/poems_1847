SURPRISING BEAUTIES
Your heart
shows me surprising beauties.
Your love
whispers me surprising beauties.
Your face, I keep it,
my dear,
through so many pleasures
of my eyes.
I have put your soul
to sing our love
to distances.
My dear soul,
who loads me with an astral shiver,
come into my heart
with these surprising beauties.
