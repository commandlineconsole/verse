DIET AND DIGESTION
I had felt crucified,
In those days long gone by...
When I had admitted to witnessing,
What others would deny and permitted.
I was thought to be then,
On a mission of negativity.
And that was the furthest thing,
From my objective mind.
I observe activities exactly as they are.
With no excuses for them to make.
And today those same folks who are broke,
Disgusted and choking back tears...
Now are willing to admit,
Their quality of life has taken a nose dive into pits.
'I'm sure you have concerns about this? '
I do!
And I've been taught to limit my concerns,
To exercise, diet and digestion with daily meditation!
