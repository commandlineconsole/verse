'AFTERMATH'...
Its weird only when its a cry;
Its mild and a norm to be without a fright;
cataclysmic experiences  bury forever plight;
Unexpected predicaments to contend with all the remain might;
weirdness conceived...
Sojourn in the land of fear;
Cheap commodities of fright for sale;
what a journey to embark on by this new itinerant!
Lucid variations of harmonious feeling of fear;
pale pedestrians sail in their pairs...
A new life of charade for the fear of fear;
recurring encasulation of the reason for the tear;
the fear to play;
even to pray;
All squadron withdraw, retreat and hide with personalities of lesser fear;
still, no not one, that is not borne with this same fear.
