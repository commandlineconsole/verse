PASSION
When I find the girl
She's gonna be my world
Cuz that's Passion
I'ma be with her every second
So she never feels neglected
Cuz that's Passion
I'ma make her smile every minute
So she knows we're still in it
Cuz that's Passion
If she ever has to go
I'ma make sure she knows
That even when shes away
My thoughts of her will always stay
Cuz that's Passion
We'll spend long nights under the stars
Just chillin' and lookin' up at planet mars
We'll talk about our life
I'll learn about my future wife
Cuz that's Passion
I'll bring her to a special place
And brush my fingers down her face
Then stare into her eyes
And take her by surprise
When I softly kiss her lips
With my hands holdin' her hips
Near a tree full of Doves
We'll be surrounded by Love
And I'll feel the sweet divine
Knowing she's FINALLY mine
Cuz that's Passion.
