ONE OF US
He knows, first hand, what I feel
He knows how I feel
He feels what I feel
My God, Jesus
He lived here
Heâ€™s been here
He knows what I know
He experienced pains, joy, laughter, tears,
My pains are His pains,
My joy is His joy
My humor is His humor
My life was made by Him, for His worship
What touches me, touches Him
What concerns me, concerns Him
My God experienced this earth
He was here, lived here, roamed here
He saw us, smelled the earth, touched us,
tasted our food, and heard our voices
My God knows me,
He was and is one of us.
He made me,
He loves me.
All is possible with Him
Who strengthens me.
