FATHOM
Fathom the earth without sorrow
Would the heart of the traveler show gain
To not lessen from dirt  that was fashioned
From the bowels of the earth without pain?
Surely the mantle of sorrow spoken of in lifes refrain
Must be formed by the paths that we travel
Our choices net us our gain
Strength of character boldly is a treasure worth seeking to find
All that life has to offer
Choose paths that seek honors' refrain.
