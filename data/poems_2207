ANGER
Anger is deep inside me…
Anger is what you fear…
The anger I have inside me gets out of my body…
This anger comes from a broken heart…
This anger comes from my heart…
This anger is never going to die…
This anger  wants to kill…
When I am force to show my anger just get out of my way…
My anger is a red danger…
This anger is not a stranger…
I should be locked up in a cage for all my rage…
Just put my anger on delay…
Before I display…
If you don’t then you will pay…
In time it may go away…
