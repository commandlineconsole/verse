FEELINGS-07
Sadness is like being lost
Happiness is like nothing can go wrong
Music is like a summer day
Paris Hilton is an old forgotten dog
Excitement is overrated happiness
Boredom is what i feel everyday
Depression can be like a reflection of my life
Joy is a rare feeling i get when i feel loved
Pain is the hurt and sorrow you put me through
Misery is like having no one to stand beside you
Sadness is like being lost
Happiness is like nothing can go wrong
