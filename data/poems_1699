PLEASURE LIES IN CHOSEN PATH
Each one is conditioned to learn a way
To trigger the spot of pleasure in his brain
And that holds one happy in oneâ€™s pursuit.
The misers and the spendthrifts,
The dictator and the slave,
The martyrs and the hoarders,
The one who eats, drinks and is merry
And the one fasting and wasting
All thus find their pleasure
In their respective pursuist, constantly.
