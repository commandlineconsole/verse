A GREAT DESIRE
Bundle of joy and dreams true
I wish for the lovely you
For you are the greatest friend
Whose love has no bound nor end
For this is my great desire
To bring you the joy's fire
With which you can surely light
The happiness candle to bright
The pain of life and the road
To share your burden and load
Where happiness will surely stay
To brighten your joy in your way.
