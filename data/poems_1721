SURRENDER
a violent thrust
a gasping breath
each escaping sound
lulling into a frenzied
scrape of flesh
a twist a turn
moaning
as if never to feel this pleasure again
petal soft lips searching
for something to hold on to
nails gripping
teeth biting a wave of pleasure up the spine
feather light fingers
tracing a sickenly sweet caress
beckoning a surrender of mind and body
a spasm
a cry
eyes wrench open in a fevered glaze
but only to find
that her dream
was only but a dream
