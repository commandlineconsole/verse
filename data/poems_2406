TORN
You have torn my heart out.
You have made it bleed.
I want you to feel what I feel
I want you to take heed.
To tell you how much you hurt me
To tell you how you can DARE.
Anger boils up inside.
Anger, I donâ€™t care.
You with your boyish charms,
You with the alluring eyes,
I gave you my whole body
I gave you me, and I despise.
Say that I am incredible,
Say that I am unique,
Anger I believed your verbal skills,
Anger at the lies you speak.
You clearly have a way with women.
You entice them with your words,
I was drawn in by your helplessness
I was drawn in - I feel absurd.
God, help me let those feelings go.
God, help me to forgive.
God let me learn to love again,
God let me learn to live.
