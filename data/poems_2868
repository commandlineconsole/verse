AT IT'S BEST
My life was once empty,
I would wallow in my bed,
as thoughts of someone to love me,
resided in my head,
I would stare out my window,
and watch the days go by,
days of only sadness,
days I only cried,
watching as others held hands,
and share the love they had,
I try to be happen for them,
but it only made me sad,
relationships were of many,
but none of them true,
the path of sadness I walked,
was leading me to you,
I guess to take away the pain,
to forget about the rest,
to shine your love down on me,
now my life is at it's best.
