BURNING SOUL
A dark raging flame of anger burns deep inside my soul,
Life itself has taken so many things away from me,
Friends and family have left my angered soul to rot on this lonely planet,
The center of my soul has been accused of being hell,
Yet if that is true then hell has frozen over,
A dark raging flame of anger burns deep inside my soul,
The candles flame has almost died down completely,
When it goes out my life will finally end,
I will finally be with my friends and family,
Weather it be in heaven or hell my soul will forever dread this Earth,
My soul will dread the people on this planet,
My soul will dread these actions that my imperfection has bestowed upon me,
I may have a choice,
But who wants to make that decision,
A dark raging flame of anger burns deep inside my soul
My life will soon come to an end and I will finally be happy.
