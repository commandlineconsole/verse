VITA PRO MEUS LEO-AMO ANGELUS
Fear not the world, my Leonine…
Fear not the silent times between.
Fear not the chance of loneliness,
fear not that love could whither yon.
Cometh hither, my Leonine…
Cometh to promised snow,
Cometh and see the world!
Cometh to mine promise kept.
Hold on to thy heart, my Leonine.
Hold on to thy gifts from Him.
Hold on to me, hold on to honour.
Hold on! For the right ones will come.
Fear not the world, my Leonine,
Fear not the possibilities that it holds.
Fear not that love will whither:
Fear not the extinct chance of loneliness.
