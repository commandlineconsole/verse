THE ARGUMENT
do not ever ask why God should care for you
but ask yourself how you can care for God?
To love someone you cannot love
Is the best love that you can give to God
To care for someone whom everyone has abandoned
Is the utmost care that you can give to God
For God and Man are One.
You are not just Man.
