LESSON
Fear ye not a lack of cash
For it won't bring you wealth
Fear not the lack of will to dash
For it won't bring you health
Fear ye not the city suits
They know not what they do
Fear ye not your lowly roots
It doesn't detract from you
Fear ye not the rising seas
Just move up on the hill
Fear ye not the new disease
They'll soon invent a pill
Fear ye not the governments
Whose avarice they breed
Fear ye not the covenants
You decide your creed
Fear not social stigma
You'll be who you will be
Your karma runs over their dogma
And then perhaps they'll see
Fear ye not the bogeyman
With children in his sack
But heed your wasted time
Because it's never coming back.
