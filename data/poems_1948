BLUE IN YOUR EYES
I look in your eyes
They're faded now
and to my surprise
The sun won't rise
It's jaded now
I've played it out
Inside of my thoughts
I'm always here
I'm never there
Always for you
Never for them
I don't know when
I decided to care again
But I'm so glad I did
It's not like me
To have this kind of empathy
It's not like you
To have this shade of blue
In your eyes
and to my surprise
I feel the sunrise
We may not be able to see it
but it has such a comforting heat
Let it bleed out and touch your heart
The start of something much more comfortable
