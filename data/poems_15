**LOVE 1939
Love 1939
Written on every  tree
In bold the name of me
She accepts
My proposal and she writes

I love you too
As usual we teens do
In nineteen thirty nine
I leave  her safe under  the tree, pine
My cycle
Buckle tight to the bark
And I promise to the soil to return back quick
The cycle is eaten up half
As the missing time of mine considerably enough
The rain of pain here was so severe
Unable to bear, my love, at  first turned to stone
And then washed  away into the river.
