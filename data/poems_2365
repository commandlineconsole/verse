ANGER
I feel so angry,
my anger's taking over me,
pooring trough my veins,
my body loses its control
anger's Blinding me,
So I can't see,
I handle with such madness,
bringing others fear,
wrapped around sadness,
anger has me in her hands,
I'm fighting against my oldest fear
hoping this fight will release me,
fear has taking me over,
it brought me back in trouble,
maybe this time I've gone to far
because I just couldn't let it go....
