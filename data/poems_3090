NOWHERE TO HIDE
You might not understand the way I write because I write for me
This is my selfish exploit, my medicine, for the acid-
This is how I choose to drown my sorrows, I hid them, quid
In a sea of deeper sorrow, that goes deeper still... can't you see
Sorrow for sorrow, can't you see, this my strategy
To chasten the pain with an ever greater pain
To drive out the darkness by further causing all light to wain
To float in a sea of all I truly am
For surely this, this really is me, All I am, All I can
Muster is my fake face, but the monster
Dripping in darkness and blood, he lurks just under that mask
I know him, he is not gone, and he is hungry
Hungry, hungry, hungry, always inside
Hungry, hungry, hungry, left with nowhere to hide
Hungry, hungry, hungry, waiting to devour
This very hour I realize I've always been running
But I get nowhere, because I am already nowhere
And nowhere is certainly no place to hide.
