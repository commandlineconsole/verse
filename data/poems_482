CONTROLLING SITUATIONS
I thought there was passion
In the world
Passion in things like love
Passion in me especially
But it's all so heavy hearted
Somewhere along the way
I've forgotten what it was
To laugh
To let go of control
Because I can't hold on
To all of the strings
And that's hard for me
I can't control the world
And all of its happenings
I can't control storms
Truth
Or lies
I can't control who lives
Or who dies
What difference do I make
If I cry about little things
Big things
Maybe if I just laugh
I can let go
Of control
for awhile.
