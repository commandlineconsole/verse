LOVE
love is a need
for human and animals too,
love is a care you do,
Love is here and there,
love is all around,
love shines in eyes,
love can be expressed in words,
or love can be felt through silence,
Love is a lovely feeling,
Love is gracious with soft dealing,
Love is nothing but includes everything,
Changes the surrounding in magic,
love is a happiness,
love is sacrifices for being more happy,
love is a complete understanding,
we all love our loved ones, closed ones,
because love is a generous and pure feeling
