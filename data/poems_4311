I FEAR EVERYTHING, MY DEAR
I fear everything, my dear,
Though I am sad to say.
I fear many a thing, my love,
Regretfully you among them.
I fear all emotions of life, my sweet,
They cloud better judgement.
I fear, I'm sad to say this dear,
But I can never love you,
No matter how much I want to.
I fear everything, my dear,
Though I wish it wasn't so.
I fear many things, my love,
And you scare me as well.
For I fear all emotions, my sweet,
And you make my heart sing.
But I can never show my weakness,
That my biggest fear of all,
Is ever losing you.
