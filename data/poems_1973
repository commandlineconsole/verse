MY GREEN EYE FATE
surprised
im so lost in your eyes
enthused
to wipe away your blues
fate
your the one i choose
sailing threw time
with nothing to lose
unlock my chained heart
beauty i cant refuse
bright green eyes shining threw
wondering if i give life too
surprised
im so lost in your eyes
enthused
to wipe away your blues
fate
your the one i choose
