INSCRIPTIONS : V.
--Winter is dead! Hark, hark, upon our hills
The voices for whose coming thou didst yearn!
Hail Spring! O Life, with happy Spring return!
O Love, revive! Joy's laugh the dawntide fills,
--I shall not see him coming, Joy the vernal,
Joy the heart-wakener, with his songs and roses:
To thee the Spring: to me Death, who discloses
The splendour of another Joy, eternal!
