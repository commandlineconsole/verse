A TIME TO CELEBRATE
The fierce joy
Lurching my stomach
Avalanche in my heart
Of delight
A smile curved on the once sad lips
The eyes that once glistened with tears
Now twinkle with delight
The once heavy, brooding heart
Occasionally ablaze with fire
Now light and smiling
The head that once held tension
The second home for headaches
Now light and relaxed
At last,
I have broken from all negatives
I broke free and ran
Plunged into the pools of delight
Cool and refreshing
Washing away all the sorrows
All the miseries
Closing my eyes to the darkness
Opening them to the light
Surely, thereâ€™s no such thing like hope
It is truly a time to celebrate
