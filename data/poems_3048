LIFE ISN'T FAIR = ETERNAL SORROW
my heart is dying
more and more each day
I really need
this sorrow to go away
This pain I feel
because what life has caused
I will always feel pain
just...because
tears flow from me
like blood from a wound
and there they sit before me
reminding me of gloom
My sorrow is eternal
it won't go away
I really need a friend
because my heart has been betrayed
my sorrow is eternal
and it will always be there
and now I know as a fact
life isn't fair
