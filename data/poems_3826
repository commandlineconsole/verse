I HAVE PROBLEMS ALL OF MY OWN
Look at you why should I care.
If you have a hard time making ends meet.
Why should I care if you child does not have shoes on there feet?
Why should I care if you sleep under the street lights?
On a cold dark winter's night.
Don't bother me.
I have problem all of my own
It not my falt that you in the condition that you are in.
Why should I care?
If  your child doesn't have enought to eat.
Why should I care?
Go away and leave me alone
Don't you see.
I have problems all of my own.
In the ending as in the beginning.
You ask why I should care.
I care my child because.
I am involve in the welfare of all mankind
