ADVISE
“Never make your Hobby your job”
My father once did advise
For if you do what stirs your soul
And rules your passions dies
Sound advice from a man that knew
A man that took his passion and made it his job
And bid his passion adieu
“Never Make your Hobby your Job”
Advice I took to heart
My passion and I shall never part
