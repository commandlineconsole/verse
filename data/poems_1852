HOLDER
Feeling sweet hokum
I'm hoisting this dream
hold me, hold me up
hold me up I'm in hole
voice holler dia surprise
I can fill it
I can sense it
I can touch it
I'm holder.
When I dream at night
two men stand beside our bed
should understand that I fear
some one coughs
some one in-love with you
all are looking to you dia surprise
I can recognize it
I can understand it
I'm holder.
Day time with moon
cold hasty touch my bones
your the one to know where hot is
some one to hold me
I'm in-love with you
all are in my hands dia surprise
I can sense it
I can know it
I'm holder.
When our heart met again,
could be new life at a moment
will take and share my world
some one to to love you
together we can dia surprise
I can feel it
I believe it
I'm holder.
