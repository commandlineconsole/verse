FEAR
When fear arises
The fear who owns a great dept to death
Fear dominating all in its path
Unstoppable
Uncontrollable


When fear strikes
Fear is feared
People will cower in the presence of this beast
He will play with you as a child would a toy
You are that which is insignificant

Finding fear at my feet
Vanquished
Concord at the gates of desertion
Concord when all hope had ran
Concord when the moon shined brightest

When fear flees
Running back to its master
Running from the pain its has caused
The remorse of his friends
Friends a man once good
