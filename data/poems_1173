PEACE
Peace is the melody
Of God’s rhythm
Showering from Heaven
For peaceful delight
To cultivate the compassion
Kindness    and forgiveness
In the Human mind
Peace is the austerity
Of God’s welfare
Evincing prosperity
In Human life
Peace is calm and positive
In its attitude
Jubilant virtue
Against Demon’s speech
Luminous fabricant
Of Love and friendship
A congenial march to
Universal harmony
Without peace
Abolition of poverty and
Prosperity in human life
Is unexpected
May God bless the people of this earth
For a peaceful delight.
