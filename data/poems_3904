REASON
I might not be perfect
I might not be sweet
I might not be accepted
I might be alone
I might be gone
I might die soon
But  who would care
My 'family' left me alone
My 'friends' never cared
My heart never loved
I would die alone
cold hearten, alone, unwanted, unloved
Never accepted
But who would care?
Would I care?
I don't see the reason
I shouldn't die?
I disappeared
Finally I would be gone
It works out for you and me
