IN THE HUSH CALM OF THE TWILIGHT
In the hush calm of the twilight
When Day Becomes Night
No doubt Moonlight  to trespass
On Our Eve
envisioning the glisten in your eyes
exposed to the moons angelical mood
As we lay laughing stylishly nude.
Performing Love Sonnets
The sheet music of our Hearts...Off The Charts
Delicate and Tender
intrigue of a love story  surrounds  the melody of our hearts
The flavor of stimulation, excitation, arousal
Wrapped in your arms
engrossing  to my clutches
candles shine their flame blazing on our passions
The scent of sweet perfume
Drives my desire higher
The expression in your eyes
The sensation of your thighs
Succulent and sexy Before thee
endeavoring this pleasure
To savour the sweetness of you
In the exploration of you.
whispering  poetry of passion
You lost in my body as time goes by
Lost in a erotic  fashion
Thy body comes alive
Your the heat of my desire
My Passions...Into Action
Naked Before Each Other
As we Lay each other down
While you welcome my caress
your juicy sexy thighs
Makes me cry...With passion
Your flavor...I belabor
Yor breast like mountains
touching them loving them with a supple kiss
Lost inside your juices
To a sexy love experimentation
Passions Rise
Lost in all positions
Pleasure is the purpose
For
XTC is here
Wapped inside my arms
Me Yours
To this explosive passion shared
No one can come asunder
This passion will take us higher
Only you can fill my heart
Beat my heart with desire
