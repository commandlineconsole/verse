MY FEARS
Every day there is a fear, but I’m afraid to shed a few tears. The tears remind me of that fear; although they show me bravery is near. I fear of many different things, because of the things I have seen. I often fear of dying, because I saw so much through this life. Nobody promised me this life would be easy, only promised I would live it good. I try to be brave and face my fears, but when it’s time to be brave, I break down into tears. Everyone has a fear as you may see; I’ll get through mine and be the best I can be. Facing your fears will be the best thing to do, if you believe, you can face yours too.
