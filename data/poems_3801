I WAS TO TIRED TO CARE
I  was to tired to care, about what i wore.
I  was to tired to care, about my hair.
I  was to tired to care, about my life.
I was to tired to care, why you had to go and leave me here.
I  was to tired to care, why im not ever happy.
I  was to tired to care, how you up and left me.
I  was to tired to care, about you just packing up and leaving me behind, and not even having the heart to tell me till you were about to leave on that plane.
I was to tiredcto care, about my heart breaking
And it was then when I felt true pain.
