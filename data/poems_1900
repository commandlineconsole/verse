I HAVE NO POEM TONIGHT/ BUT LIFE IN ITS STRANGE BEAUTY SURPRISES
I HAVE NO POEM TONIGHT/ BUT LIFE IN ITS STRANGE BEAUTY SURPRISES
I have no poem tonight
But life in its strange beauty surprises
And somewhere looking up at the sky
I see
An endless hope-
A beauty beyond any dreaming
A depth of light and black and night
No one could ever imagine alone.
This world of God sometimes-
Is as much a true home,
As for me
A true poem.
