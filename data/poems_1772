TIME
Newer pleasure discovered...
dusty places old and new.
Such comparison
aging new
showing plainly
as dusty places
fall prey
to rays christening sun
Pleasures turn mirrors
and years ring by
old clocks
with blue faces
watch time build
dusty layers.
Fewer times seconds matters not
old and new brighter within
reflect round confusion
twelve countless numbers
discovering you
