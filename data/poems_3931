GODNESS WAS LOVE
Godness was love
Never was and never will be
Godness is life
And everything that surrounds me
So destroy the day
Destroy the world
Destroy the night
Destroy the air
The day not care
The world not care
The night not care
The air not care
Godness was love
She walked with me
Godness was love
But I couldn't her see
Air and life, love and life, water and life together
