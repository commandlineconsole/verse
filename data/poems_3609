TYPICAL GIRL
I am typical shy girl
Parent often call me pearl
Many pet names are kept by sisters
When I hear them my eyes glitter
I love to laugh and offer broad smile
I never stay indoors and even daily run for miles
Study and house hold works take lots of time
I smilingly accept and never show displeasure any time
May it be it is natural gift?
I have witnessed no more shift
I am same as was before
No one criticizes me but praise and adore
I am named as naughty and trouble shooter
Take whole house on heels and put on hooter
They will demonstrate toughness but melt
As I am so dear to them and it can be seen or felt
I present with hand signs all beautiful acts
Some of them may be of funny or sarcastic
They all will burst into laugh and forget
I shall be again in original color and firmly set
I am about to cross my tender age
Soon I shall be facing blossom of young age
I shall be at the height of spring
With no more innocent smile but with flight with wings
Everybody knows about my free and frank nature
But they are concerned and making it sure
I am their first priority and major concern
They are not alarmed but some unknown fire burn
I can hardly think of such things and address their concern
I know and share fully well that next will be my turn
I will have to improve upon my behavior
Show them some improvement for what I stand for
I am love bird and love all small kids
They come in evening and provide me lead
I make strong team and win always
But alas! Now I have to hand over charge and search new way
