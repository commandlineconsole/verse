EARLY WORKS - CARING
Caring is about the little things
tears on a sunny day
for friends who may have gone away.
Caring, a word with such expression
when times are hard
the out stretched willing helping hand.
Caring a thing, we cannot always see,
but itâ€™s nice to know
that there is always someone there.
Caring something, we always need
a cherished thought
by someone, anyone who cares.
