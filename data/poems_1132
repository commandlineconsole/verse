DELIGHT IN PHOENIX
Delight in gilbert
COnstant dessert
Delight in phoenix
a river of we dids
the maids outfit the toys
the pleasures and the joys
a cute little model with the sweetest sound
i kinda want to keep her around
Then i am gone again
whizzing back to LA
to die and kill again
To steal just one more day
My toy awaits in Gilbert
TO again be my dessert
2008
