UP WITH THE BIRDS
UP WITH THE BIRDS
to go up with the birds,
what he saw there,
was unable due to walls,
he had seen a hideen world,
in the shadow of active world,
surprised completly surprised he was,
with increasing extent of that opposite world,
which resides around us,
that day he came to know,
walls also had so much thing to say,
he decided to aware the people of his world,
about the hidden world,
unsafe and unsecure,
not to become prey of their shadow world,
but unfortunately he didnt come back........
