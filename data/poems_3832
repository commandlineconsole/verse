GIVING UP TO GIVE AWAY
You're just another who has run out of luck.
And living amongst the others,
Who have decided...
To throw their hands up!
You're just another one seen,
Not to be around them to strut.
With a chosen disposition,
As if to say, 'So what! , if I sit around on my butt.'
Who cares,
If initiative is not there?
Who cares,
If initiative is not there?
Who cares,
If initiative is not there?
With a bottled up...
Giving up!
Who cares,
If they're living in a danger?
Who cares,
About a pain feeling stranger?

Bottled up,
With tensions that are on display!
