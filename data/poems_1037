MY DREAMS ARE RIVERS
My Dreams are Rivers
Thru day and night
True rainbows shivers
When sun is bright
But when itâ€™s darker
Its glow will brake
That once was a sparker
Will now in tears wake
Some days are night
In its sorrows land
Where sun is not bright
In joy to understand
But pain in its caress
Its flowing on hours
So much of joy assess
And fallen sun flowers
My dreams that were day
And still are calling
When nights on its way
In darkness falling
Its brightness must go
To become darker still
So joy will have its glow
For new dreams to fulfill
