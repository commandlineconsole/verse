JOY
Joy is a treasure to behold
It lightens the heart,
Or so I am told
Often sought, seldom found
It is the grease that
Lets this world go round
It is indeed a treasure
One of a few that
Always bring you pleasure
Yes joy is made of gold spun thread
So fragile yet so valuable
Always longed for, so it is said
So today seek your greatest joy
Don't treat it lightly
For your greatest joy isn't a toy
Wrap it tight in your arms
Treasure it always.
Ever keep it from harm
It'll serve you well when the chips are down
When the sun stops shining
When on your face grows a frown
