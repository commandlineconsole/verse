RIPPLES IN A RIVER
I walked up to a crystal clear river
Where I looked into the water and seen my reflection
Soon I began to see grey clouds in the air
Reflecting the sadness I started to feel
Looking at the rain drops slowly collapsing in the water
My own tears have started to fall from my cheeks
As the rain and tears touch the river
The ripples spread out in different directions
At last I see the sun coming out
And the clouds slowly disappear
The rain has stopped and my sadness slowly begins to fade away
