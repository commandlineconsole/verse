LET HER STAY
Catch the vain of sorrow
The vast emptiness of the world
These people are rude, they'll be more tomorrow
They just stay rude and cold
People can't see the truth in their lies
Many call her fake
Because they couldn't see the truth if they tried
These people are pushing her to break
She won't let them win
Pardon her if she's in your way
Yo can say her existence is a sin
She hates your existence every single day
You push her around
Make fun of her sorrow everyday
But she's never made a sound
Why does she even stay
Catch the sorrow in your veins
The world is full of emptiness
Her clothes filled with blood stains
But she tried her best
