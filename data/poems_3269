GOD KNOWS MY NEEDS
God knows that I need soulmate
to stay as a treasure in my heart.
Someone who be so truthful
Superior and moderate.
God knows that I want to smile
to go out of my harsh way
That I need a celebrity so charming
who can clothe my ache with adore.
God knows that I require the awareness
of a celebrity who feel for me
In the night when the moon shines
The light of romances shine on us
And flow sleeps in comfort togethernessâ€™
God knows that I want to share
My happiness and bliss
My sorrowfulness and depression
with my soulmate who can wipe up my tears
And embrace me so affectionately.
So I may wake up to see
The first rays of the sun that shine in my eyes.
God knows the whole lot about me
