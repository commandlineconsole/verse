FEAR
Fear of confusion,
Fear is alway there,
Fear stalks there,
Fear stalks us,
Fear of you
Fear is the smell of,
malicious grind of,
a walking devil
Fear of truth,
Everyone has fear
They don't even know,
where it comes from
The feeling ruling and,
runing this world
Fear of tomorrow
Fear was my one true enemy
Fear loses when I am close,
to you.
