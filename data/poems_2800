HERE I STAND
dancing in the rain
feeling the cold drops on my face
washing all the pain and hurt and sadness away
filling me with a new strength and a new peace
a sense of calm and tranquility among the thunder
washing away the tears of sadness
big drops of rain
falling onto my upturned face
the beauty and strength of the storm
rush through my bones
making me believe
in fate
in love
in myself
making me believe
that one day
the sun will come out
and this will be
nothing
but a
dream.
