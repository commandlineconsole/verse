THE VALLEY
At times, pain can overcome joy
There's really nothing to be done
Except to sit through the darkness
And to wait for the rising sun
Although it may very well seem
The horizon might ne'er embrace
The bright rays of a brand new day
And although hope seems out of place
Remember the dawn is coming
Remember that glorious sight
Look to the stars in the darkness
And just picture the morning light
As it rises from east to west
Illuminating each valley
Don't lose hope within the shadows
For joy, will soon, again, rally
Yes, as it brightens every valley
Remember, joy will soon, again, rally
