FEAR
Fear is like fallen leaves,
It scatters in distant dreams,
It shutters all walks like swollen seeds,
It gathers all thoughts with broken means,
It waters all talks instantly,
Fear falls to follow immediately,
Tear falls the narrow,
Mere thoughts have a shadow,
That shadows and follows
The darkest without know,
Fear is a fear that fears in fear a while ago,
It denies a leaf the new day,
But strongest hearts rise to the moon clear,
Fear is a useless emotion,
Fear denies us possibility,
And possibility is what we seek to empower the will,
And our Will is our liberator and bringer of joy,
Fear is always an illusion,
A feeling attached to either events
Or objects that are hypothetical,
Fear only works to limit our potential,
Fear knows no color,
Fear crawls in closer,
Fear soils away the future,
It is like broken states of matter,
It channels its way into a brother,
To harness its toes to a   father,
Fear pours like falling rain by the river,
And fouls a daughter and its mother,
Fear downs like a fallen hero,
When strongest hearts rise to the moon clear,
Fear drowns like a broken mirror,
When longest touch rise to the noon clear,
Fear shouts like a stolen Negro,
When strongest ones wise to the new day,
Don't fear, neither despair,
As hopeless souls rise to the moon clear.
