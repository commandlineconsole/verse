SONNET # 212
What blossomy of sex a woman grows
When she likes the man and feels his tool!
What heaven of delights her face quite shows
When there inside her soul nothing is cool!
And nothing makes one comes a quiker thing
Than the movement of a she gone to her head.
The man feels pleasure to his highest king.
The man inside can`t hold and comes to spread.
And tell me what you see when it is through,
And she was satisfied and had it happy.
She is peaceful look, the sky when blue.
You by her side a man of looks so pretty.
