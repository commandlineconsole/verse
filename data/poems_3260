PAIN OF HEART
It beats, again it beats
sounds as someone beat
It bawl, but no one hear
Only, came out a tear
Something latent
which is inexpressible
And yea, not adorable
Lonely hearts pain bellow
but a wayward, never gripe
Feelings find way to insertion
now, its time for salvation
Before a itch rouse
for a pleasant row
Let it repose on the bed of rosette
Its tenderness will heal the pain
no loss, no gain
Unaware from the entire mundaneness
and nobody beside with sorrowfulness
So, the count down trigger
it roar twitter
With renounced hope, heartbeat stop
