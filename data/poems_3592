I HAVE NOW LEARNED (I)
I have now learned
Where dwells the love
You have concerned
It all above
Resentment burned
Of hate there of
And that returned
With further love
I have now learned
What greenest grows
And what has earned
A blooming rose
It is love dear
Affectionate feel
Of one who'll care
Not break its seal
It is all there
If we try find
The feelings here
Those are combined...
