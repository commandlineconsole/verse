TO WHOM IT CONCERNS
TO WHOM IT CONCERNS;
I JUST WANNA HIDE
BUT WHERE WOULD I GO?
THE ANSWER: SUICIDE
TO WHOM IT CONCERNS;
LIFE JUST ISN’T WORTH IT
THE PAIN; THE SUFFERING
SO TIRED OF THIS BULLSHIT.
TO WHOM IT CONCERNS;
WHO KNOWS THE REAL ME?
IT’S ALL A FACADE
SO ALL WILL LEAVE ME BE.
TO WHOM IT CONCERNS;
I’M JUST LOOKING FOR LOVE
TO GIVE AND TO GET SOME
WOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH

BUT THAT’S TOO MUCH TO ASK
AND THAT REALLY BURNS.
SUICIDE IS MY ANSWER
TO WHOM IT CONCERNS.
