MY DAUGHTER
That day so long ago
She came into my life
Beautiful
Innocent
Love filled me
I held her
Delight and joy
That moment
Etched in the recess of my soul
What was destined for this gift
Thankful I shall always be
All I had I would give her
as the years have past
She has brought me more
Joy and delight than I deserved
For she has made me
A better person
