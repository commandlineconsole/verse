COMPLICATE THE MEMORIES
Chronicles are the adversary tonight
Falling apart in between memories of delight
Such appetizing emotions come to mind
Filling up your heart with contentment
What would it feel like tonight
To complicate the love in sight
Bestowing the memories to the merciless life
Full of thoughts coming at you to mortify your life
Life is good
The way it is now
To feel in control
To break open every bubble filled with chronicles
Of beautiful passion and memories
And destroy everything that can harm the fragile soul
Chronicles are the adversary tonight
Falling apart in between memories of delight
Such appetizing emotions come to mind
Making you feel like youâ€™re in heaven all the time
