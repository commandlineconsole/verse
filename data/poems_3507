TO THE LORD
Concerned or cornered? o'Lord Thyself decide
Speaking out from the fraternity of disabled
To ally with Thy bliss desired
Figured out Thy model noble
On paper, wood, stone..a sacred ideal
A celestial idol the disabled forged
O'Lord impaired did Thee too descend
Law of nature? If true
Even Thee impaired have we to accrue?
A multitude of creatures
A mundane bulk of pride and prejudice
Disrespecting us in Thou mighty sphere
Concerned or cornered we here?
Virtuous or impaired Thee there?
Thy omnipotence biased? Benighted here hilighted there?
O'Lord empathize.Grant Thou benevolent showers
Imbue with us, with our silenced limbs
Assay our struggle Thyself then decide
These mortals to be cornered?
