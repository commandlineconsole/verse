'ARISE'...
Where all is Pure and the Spirit doth flow
In Holy Unison my heart doth go
In Presence Sublime it casts me weak
So humble the soul and countenance meek
Elation..Oh Pleasurer..Oh Soul of Delight
Oh Time so still in exquisite flight
Gaudere! Gaudere! Gaudere! ..my heart sings
In flight with You..what delight it brings
'Arise, come with Me'..Your Words to release
Wrapped up in Your Wings..what Perfect Peace
Above earthly knowledge..a Place Oh so high
My Beloved..my Friend..Sing I...Sing I...
