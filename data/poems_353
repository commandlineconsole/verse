I LOVE BECAUSE I CAN
I don't love because of want
I don't love because of man
Some say that loves a stunt
But I love because I can
I can love without a reason
I can love just because
I can love through any season
Any decent person does
Some say that love is blind
But to me they are just fools
I say that love is kind
And one of many tools
It gives us inspiration
Yet provokes the greatest pain
It gives a nice sensation
And is anything but plain
Though love can hurt us so
It's worth the pain and tears
To the moon for love I'd go
If it took a million years
It's better to have loved and lost
Than to have never have loved at all
And for love I'd pay that cost
And climb a mountain tall
One may think that I'm crazy
One may think that I'm insane
But those who don't love are lazy
And are lacking heart and brain
I can love without a reason
I can love just because
I can love through any season
Any decent person does
I don't love because of want
I don't love because of man
Some say that loves a stunt
But I love because I can
