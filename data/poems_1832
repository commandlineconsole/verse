IT COMES BY SURPRISE
Number one,
Isn't easy to achieve...
Or can be handled by the squeamish.
Number one,
Takes unshakable faith...
With motivation that's unbreakable.
Number one,
Isn't seen in one's eyes...
It just comes by surprise.
Success that comes to one,
Comes by surprise.
Although it may be wished,
It comes by surprise.
It's not a gift to pick,
It comes by surprise.
Nobody sits until it comes by surprise.
