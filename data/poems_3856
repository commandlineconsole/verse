SHE SAYS THAT SHE CARES
She says that she cares
But it seems only when convenient
I'd do anything for her
And give her the world
I wish I knew if she honestly cared
Just as a friend, not the way I care
Because sometimes a friend is what you need
Even better than what could be more
If I don't talk to you
You say you miss it
But when I don't talk
Neither do you
It makes me wonder
If you really care
Or if it's all a lie
But I hope that it's true
