TWO FORCES
while one builds a bridge
the other takes its time destroying it
while the other grows the branch
the other cuts it
one concerns itself with life
gentle, tender, sympathetic
the other concerns itself with death
cruel, hard, indifferent, hateful
opposed, true
but they go together in the eons of time
hand in hand
like two parallel lines moving in infinity
