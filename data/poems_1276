I BELONG TO YOU
When the morning sun
shines upon the horizon
and jewels of dew drops
glitter in delight
upon green, green grass
and flowers blossom
like a motherâ€™s charm
as the wind delights
in beautiful fragrances
let me come to you
with one special wish
never to leave you
naked as a dream
for I belong to you
like a river to the ocean
you are my beginning
you are my end.
