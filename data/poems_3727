YOU DON'T CARE
You don't care that
Im alone every day
or that i cut myself
every night
You don't care that
I want to die
Or that I've contiplated
suicide
You don't care about
how i feel
you only think of yourself
And don't care about what happens to me
You don't care that
I almost killed myself
even though I told you
I've Thought about it
You don't care,
and you probably never will
