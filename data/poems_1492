AS THE NIGHT DRAWS IN
The night drew in, the moon lowered hiding from the world
Passion consumed with the lust of love
A night of power and joy
Pleasure and relief
Sensitive music and scented candles to set a mood
New sheets soon to be dirtied and defiled as pleasure consumes the conscious mind
Lips met one time, then twice and then more often as the night moved on
Heat of lust becoming apparent as the sweat started to flow
The act of sex upon them now
Who will take the lead?
Who will dominate and who will follow?
They knew soon enough as one of them proceeded to get on all fours
But before the act began a kiss short on sweet from his lips to his
The pleasure began, intense it began to come
Stereotypes and worries replaced by pleasure and lust
They're conscious minds giving away control
Time drew on and pleasure intensified
A climax was near
One man's love for another
The others lust for the man
The act of love and lust was almost over
The Climax had been delivered and enjoyed by both men
Upon they're dirty sheets they lay
Exhausted but happy of their night of joy
In love now they sleep
Ready soon for their next night of lust.
