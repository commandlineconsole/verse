ANGER
I wish I would just take ahold of anger like a solid square
I could mold it and shape it
I could turn it into the shape of a pear
I could change it around until it looked like a furious bear
I could do anything to better my anger
I didn't do anything though
Sitting back and doing nothing is lazy
I get angry for being lazy
Angry for being angry at being lazy
Anger you ruined my life
You ruined me like a castle
It once stood proud and tall with flags flowing in the wind
Now its all but rubble and the flags ripped off and flying away
The castle represents me
A once proud girl
With dreams in the distance
Then you came along Mr. Angry
You decided to pick me to turn to rubble
I understand now when someone says they would burst your bubble
You bursted it with those flames you tickle me with
The tickle of fury and anger burning up my body and burning everthing in it's way
So I wish I may
I wish I might
That my anger would just dissapate
