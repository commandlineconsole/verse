FEAR ME
Fear Me
fear me not for who I am
I just wished someone could understand
What I love and why I stand
Holding sorrow and fear hand in hand
I just need a helping hand
to help me to understand
just who I am
Sometimes I feel I have done wrong
because it hits me very strong
I just can't hold on.
Fear me not just help me now
Then foreever take that vow.
Sometimes I don't know how,
Soemone ever gets out.
Fear me when I'm angry and when the sun goes down,
Because who know what I'll have stored for this town.
Fear me when I am tired,
Especially when I just got fired.
Just fear me! ! !
