ELEGANT WORLD
Life has given sadness for all my lifetime
Which ever the seasons it given to me
All was with tears in my eyes
When someone close is in difficulty
Helplessness brings tears of blood in my eyes
Why should I live this life now?
Which (life)  had not given heal to wounds?
Life has given sadness for all my lifetime
Our own and close people act like strangers
Who know what the time plan has for us
Not deliberately some mistakes had done by me
It had given sadness in my system
Life has given sadness for all my lifetime
Whichever the seasons it given to me,
Life is a struggle and with ache together with abandoned
All were with tears in eyes
Life has given sorrows for all my lifetime
Which had never done friendship with me?
And when I met with Mr. Happiness,
it has given gifts of tears to me
Life has given very less circumstance
in which I could laugh as sunlight
Life has given sorrows for all my lifetime
It set me, a gift with tears in eyes
A gift of loneness and unseal wound
Yet Angel from heaven above award me strength
And encouraged me with a weapon of supernatural smile
To reside in this ``Beautiful World``
