SORROW CELEBRATED
Heaviness of the moment braces itself
The feel of loss utterly serene desolate
Lack lustre thoughts deeply breathed
In soulful memory of dear departed
It is sorrow celebrated in deed, in feel
Cannot be seen again, nor heard out
Grim sadness is loss, a personal one
My loss is mine and mine alone
Unseen or seen can judge
Is sorrow celebrated in thought, in heart?
A face so bright, involved to end
A heart too kind too bent to mend
So warm the feel it made to reel
Unsaid some words my ego squeals
My sorrow celebrated with unseen tears
So many thoughts so many things
In form and mind does memory bring
A struggle through that had no end
Pain in soul now streaks defend
Why does sorrow celebrate so grandly?
