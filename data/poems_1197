DISCOVERING EVERYTHING
Applying oil to wood,
wood needs loving
care, alive in the sun,
caressing the beautiful
texture, polishing it to a
shine, touching it softly,
feeling the life, glorious,
perfumed embuia, the warm
colours like precious stones,
when you walked in with your
suntanned skin, golden hairs
reflecting sunbeams, to kiss
you softly, feeling the glory
of you, a subtle whiff of after-
shave overwhelming my senses,
delighting in you  - as you
delight in me, discovering
everythingâ€¦
