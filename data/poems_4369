FEAR
The amorphous clouds threaten the Sun
of stealing its peace and shine;
but the Sun never doubts its strength
and it never whines.
Clouds lack inner strength
They have no core, no width and no length
They emanate from nowhere
and dissipate quickly to somewhere
They come and go
just like that.
I am the Soul
I am the Sun
I don't give-in to the clouds of fear
I don't let doubt come near
I listen to the true inner self of mine
I don't let fear take away my shine.

Fear is sure to veil the soul
and steal its sheen
When the inner mirror is covered with fear's dust
truth is nowhere to be seen.
Fear is the bane of life
It is the terminator of joy
I have the choice to live in fear or in love
I choose to rent the veil of fear
and live in love.
