HELP ME
Well, when I was drowning
Right under my sorrow
Nothing could stop me
Except being one of those
Who wants to see the sun tomorrow
To wash out my sorrow
I couldn't walk
I couldn't move a finger
I did my best to wake up
And start my day gladly
With my feet slow and linger
To wash out my sorrow
I tried to move very slowly
And finally I had a beat
To meet my joy, to take wing
To reach the highest sky
So cold so safe so high
To wash out my sorrow
O Allah I know you're listening
So I'll shout and yell
Very low
Help me help me
