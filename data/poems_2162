YOU TASTE LIKE DEATH
what a grand day
where you break me down again
theres nothing i enjoy
like feeling broken, used, and bland
then again
what girl doesnt
and what a terrific surprise
that you didnt surprise me at all
in fact i anticipated it
but didnt brace myself for the fall
oh silly
my momma told me
and if i fought the the gnawing hunger
or maybe just ripped my heart right out
it would be just so much easier
and thats without a doubt
but why i inquired
not to be sure
and if i wonder a bit more maybe then id know
and if i looked inside myself id become sure
but thats the question i guess ill never know
cause from all this 'experience' i still have yet to learn
