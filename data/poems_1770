MEMORY
Through the annals of time and memory distort
The accuracy of fact your mind fails to support
Some things are best left to the confusion of mind
Lest we seek discomfort in the truth that we find
Looking back over time gives great pleasure itâ€™s true
Through mist and shaded veils the picture we view
The memory indeed is a great healer with time
The comfort it brings serves to make it sublime
Contentment, resentment, pleasure or pain
Leave it to memory, in time it will feign
