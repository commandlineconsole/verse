LOVE HATES ANGER
When hatred invaded a weak thought,
The mind was prepared for defeat.
It was the will that fought,
Anger attacked without retreat.
Sad to hear the screams and cries,
Violence was the force that dictated.
With bleeding mind and denies,
Anger left the body negated.
Shame returned when all was lost,
Right was a wrong or a right choice.
Love stood faithless crisscrossed,
Regret of anger is loves voice.
