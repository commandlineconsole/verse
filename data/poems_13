LOVE -UNBOUND PLEASURE
In my heart there is a sensation
Delicate delicious soft emotion
Intoxicated sight deep sea eyes
Mysterious mystic melody lies
Hypnotic mesmerizing surprise
Glistering glorious magnetic face
Dark jet black cascading hair
Lots of secrets I wish to share
Need you to feel the depth of ocean
Height of the hill will be a true fun
Some one so near and dear, my own
Adventure feel together unknown
Unseen unsaid lots of passion wonder
Soft touch heavy breath fondling tender
Love care raw   wish inflaming desire
Naughty, sweet game played together
Slowly and gradually in pleasure unbound
Drown bottom deep in you myself I found
