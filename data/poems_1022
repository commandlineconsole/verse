ANEW
If this love
could set us free
If this love
would make us anew
I would do it all for you
If this joy
could stop time
If this joy
Could help the world
I would do it all for you
If our world
could be shared
If our world
could be happy and bright
I would do it all for you
If this world
sparkled with the moon
If this joy
fell with the rain
If our world
smiled with the sun
Alas they don't
But you do
