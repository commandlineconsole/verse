FEAR -A GLOOM
Fear is not anywhere behind mankind,
For remember it is in our own mind.
It could be removed if we make-up our mind,
Then none can impede us to be shined.

Fear is the lane of dark where nothing seemed apparent,
Except abortive and the breeze errant.
Fear is the blemish that could spoil the long life tribute,
Is it so effortless and painless to recon tribute?
Certainly not fear when you arenâ€™t erroneous,
Just one step forgetting the fear may lead u to be victorious.
Fear is just a gloom that covers your talent
And it is profitless to view yourself a gallant
To confiscate the fear, make-up you mind,
Feel triumphant leaving the weakness behind.
