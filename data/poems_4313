THE FEAR
The fear
I'm holding it hidden
But it brings out its nasty face over and over again.

The scream is getting loud
What shall I do?
It takes my spirit
My soul
I can hardly breathe.

The fear
It's waiting in the shadow
It talks to me.
I don't wanna hear
But the voice is coming closer
My heart is beating fast.

The fear is screaming for an answer.
I want some help
I see the night’s eyes in the dark

The fear has gotten into me
But I can't touch it.
The soul is burning
The heart is beating
The fear is everywhere
In every bone of my body

I can feel the sweat
I'm scared.
I'm scared of the fear.
Everything is gone
But the fear.

I can not break the fear
It’s here to stay...
