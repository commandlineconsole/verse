YOU WANT ME TO ACCEPT YOU ARE HERE TO SAVE SOULS?
You want to stop and speak to me,
About your concerns...
Of what is happening overseas?
And yet you ignore what is happening to those
Who walk upon your own neighborhood streets?
And you talk about God and your religious beliefs.
While you try to solicit many,
To come pray with you and do that on their knees?
Can you see any hypocrisy in this at all?
Some have come to find these actions quite appalling.
You would like me to believe you are concerned about humanity.
While you watch your own brothers and sisters bleed at your feet.
And you want me to accept you are here to save souls?
Which ones?
Those on the bottom of your shoes?
