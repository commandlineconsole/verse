HAPPINESS HAS COME FOR TODAY
Today I say that sadness cannot play not with my mind or my heart.  No shall I say to sadness not today for my heart is at play with no need for the seed and or misdeed of sadness today.  I say this with glee I am happy with being me and no way can sadness take anymore joy from me.  I from my head to my feet am filled with such glee that I must say with immediate need that I am glad that sadness has let me be.
For every part of me is shouting oh how happy I am with every part of me.  So I say this with a great need to expose my joy that I cannot misplace the moment that sadness left my life's race.  For now sadness takes no place in my life's race I am keeping pace with joy & glee & for at least today sadness will take no part of me...
