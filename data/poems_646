MIRACLES
“Miracles flourish from tragedy”
I believe it
With all my heart
And soul
Not with a passion borne of desperation
But with the passion borne of experience!
I’ve had tragedy in my life
Like anyone these days
Just watch the news
There is tragedy in every sentence
Every word
That is written
And read out loud to the eager public
So there must be many miracles
But these are miracles that are rarely celebrated
Rarely revealed
Only God knows of these miracles
Of human endurance
And compassion
But I’m luckier than some
Because I see my miracles
Every day –
They live with me
