ANGER
Sometimes we do not know
Something inside lumps our glow
Which is always eager to come out
And sometimes make us shout
It can erupt without any reason
It could be a loss or frustration
A break of trust or expectation
Or sometimes only rejection
Proud may breed anger
Which could shake a personâ€™s anchor
People have stress and hate
This breaks patience gates
Anger attacks relations
It may even break nations
It builds guilt and is bad for health
It even affects personal wealth
The damage is not humble
It makes forts crumble
Revenge and hate take birth
Which is unwanted on earth
But anger is pure energy
It can be utilized to create synergy
We need to pool and control it
To make success look more fit
This energy can diffuse fear
Making the path more clear
It leads to right actions
By creating certain attractions
You can meditate
Forgive and forget
You can make rules
Using them as success tools
We need to understand
That anger could be our friend
But it needs to be our slave
To make us an unstoppable wave
