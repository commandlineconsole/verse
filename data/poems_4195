FEARS
There’s a fear buried deep inside
These fears stupid to many permanently reside
Nervous talking to people as rejection I fear
For self doubts with my fears easily appear
Often this worries me till the early hours
Scared to think my actions would hurt others
I’m constantly scared incase I do the wrong thing
That others will hate what they see me within
So I hide follow my daily work routines
To allow my inner fears not to be seen
I cower to others in fear you see
Because they are much stronger than me
