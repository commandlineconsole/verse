A REPUBLIC FEAR
articulated people
led off
wherefore thereoff
into
and fed not thereof
from simple a truth.
fear i have fed you
too fear,
it is easier to control
your fear of you, your
deeds of my mistrust.
teaching all the young
why are they taught
to fear,
of they, whom can trust.
hurting us, do you fear
us/why?
and thus in the hurting
i fear why you fear me.
must it always be when
you wrong me.
you fear what you know
you have not done,
and have i wrought.
and causing my pain
you despise me.
for doing it naught
the front, the back.
and they of us, whom are
good and you counting
on that to more or less
do what, pray tell i ask.
