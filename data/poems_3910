I CARE
so many competitions
success and failures
run, chase that never ends
little ambitions, small missions
hard world and so many suggestions
dream, dream that never ends
relations and friends
ties and breaks
scream, scream that no body cares
silent and dark woods
alone; thou' in groups
fight for light, that never stops
someday it happens
someone hugh you and cares
breathe, breathe that is bless
it's not a dream
it's not a dream
it's only you! I care.. I care...
