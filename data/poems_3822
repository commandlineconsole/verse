CARERS AND THE CARED FOR..................
To visualize and comprehend difficulty
Is to apprize oneself of intellect and beauty;
Difficulty, and illness actualizes the need
For understanding's and wisdom's seed -
Caring for someone disabled or not well
Of personal genius and brilliance does foretell;
The loftiest elevation is for the carer to care -
They then dignified and highest significance wear;
Caring is of the heart, being the soundest facility,
It is of all, everything in the world, the finest humanity;
If you care, you are endowed with a precious faculty -
Of all human beings, yours is the most royal majesty;
To love and appreciate those who care and are cared for
Is to be enabled to transcend earthly limitations - to soar!
Kindness from the cared for one's and the carers
Makes all people of human greatness the partakers!
