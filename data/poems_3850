BLESSING'S RAIN
When things have gone sour
And life seems dull and blue
Then look at God my love
For He loves and cares for you
And there cling to His door
And ask Him to give you too
A part of His happiness
For he loves and cares for you
And plea to God for smiles
And for love that is true
And He will give you all
For He loves and cares for you
And tell that on no one
You can put trust dew
So send His blessings rain
For He loves and cares for you.
