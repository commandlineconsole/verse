SAVE THEIR FLESH
I fear no people other than those facts,
Inner delight arises from nations.
Let lazy ideas spark and direct,
Open them and raise them after all.
Your fear is not like mine,
Lost in delight, your nation is now empty.
May fear design a future for facts,
So let people learn and learn more.
I fear the bodies put on our face,
Ounces of flesh are saved.
