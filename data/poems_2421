EMPTINESS OF WORDS
On morning walk, I raise my eyes up,
Not like King David to the mountains,
But to purple flowers, the Pride of India
Queen’s flowers, blossoming bunches out
This hot April summer on Bandra pavement.
I look further up, sky is blue unusually!
Filled with many pieces of clouds
In different shapes and sizes;
To describe cannot go beyond
Squares, circles, triangles, rectangles etc
As if all shapes are governed by angles alone.
What about angels of irregular sponges,
Candyfloss shot through with morning silver,
Evolving like forms of life vibrant, joyful?
In this hot summer April month alone,
More than a billion Indians feel anger
And each Indian a thousand times:
Yet anger is the only available word!
Was your ‘anger’ last Monday morning
Same as of others or yours on weekend?
Like in Heart Sutra of the Buddha
Form is empty: so also, says he, feeling,
Perception, impulse, and consciousness.
Here anger is followed by other words!
