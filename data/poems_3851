LIFE
life is here
life is there
life is upsidedown
and life is inside out
life can go on for a
million miles cause i don't care
where life will lead cause  all i care about is you on this day
so life here
and life there
life alone
life everywhere and
life is gone
and i just said i don't care
where life will lead cause all
i care about is you on this
day
and
everyday
