'2010/02/24 CELESTIAL BEINGS
Pleasure is but temporary escape
from the mind, the domain of the
young and the completely insane
cry when pleasure commences
and rejoice at the end
I seek joy in eternity, immutable
infinity, the physical only intrigues
as symbolic manifestation of invi-
sible intelligent energy creating
living images momentarily
The pleasure of creating visions and
dreams, transcending reality in the
fun of mind-mastery, using bodily
senses in amazing new ways,
universes splitting infinitely
A quantum physical delight in the con-
stant change of eternally dancing sub-
atomic particles keeping innumerable
parallel universes spinning
simultaneously
Then rousing pleasures of love become
a symbol of such creative invention and
love as physical sensation is elevated to
the realm of the sublime in the sphere of
the divine  - and the domain
Of celestial beingsâ€¦
