MY BOY, MY JOY
My love, my heart
My soul, my spirit
My being, my feeling
My pleasure, my treasure
Its you my boy
Its you my joy.
My strength, my breath
My haven, my heaven
My friend, my angel
My darling, my blessing
Its you my boy
Its you my joy.
For you I live
For you I die
For you I pine
For you're divine
My sun, my son
My boy, my joy!
