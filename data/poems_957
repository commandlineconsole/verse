JOY'S SHARE
I saw with an open eye
Joy spread all on the sky
Where birds were flying high
With the message of joy's tie
It felt so good and nice
That I think it is wise
To enjoy it all twice
Even if it's small in size
So enjoy every bit my dear
Through the short road of cheer
And do it 'cause it is rare
To get easily joy's share.
