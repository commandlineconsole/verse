WHY I CARE
I worry 'cause I care for others.I know it's of my business, but I don't care 'bout the problem I care 'bout the person WITH the problem.I'm just like that and I like being like that.I like worrying for other 'cause it shows me that I dont have a darkenned heart or because it shows me that even though I have sins I'm still a good person inside.No matter what U say, no matter what my FAMILY say, no matter what the CHURCH say, I'm like that and I like the worry of the loving and the caring of others! ///-^
