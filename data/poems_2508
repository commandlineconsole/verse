FEELING THAT NEVER BEEN TOLD
the feeling is just within me
anger, pain, hurt and frustration
everyday i'm trying to let it out of my head
out of my body and just set me free
i'm angry with myself
i'm angry with my world
i'm angry with what has happened in my life
there is so much anger and frustration in me
i want to be free of all this
i want to be happy and enjoy this beautiful life of mine
i want love and love only
for me to learn about life and be happy
