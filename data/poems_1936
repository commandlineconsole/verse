COMMON SENSE
Within the house of common sense,
Their are a few, who only see,
Their mind they think is always  right,
For all the others, they think are dense,
The mind you see, was meant to think,
Not only things of interest to you,
But other interest, for all to see,
You might be surprised, you may be in sync,
Itâ€™s not what is said,
about what you think
But how you react,
And  the impressions laid,
So live a little and expand the mind,
It may hold more than you think it will,
So read and listen, with the door wide open,
You may be surprised, with  knowledge you find.
