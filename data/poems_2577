NO LOVE
I have nobody
None at all
Emptiness surrounds me
Pain covers me
Sadness, lives in me.
I am hated by all
Liked by none
That is the way my life is
Sorrow happens to be with me all the time
Every single moment I see sadness around
This great level of sadness is always with me
It will always be this way
Nothing will ever change
Only sadness will be
No love, only pain.
