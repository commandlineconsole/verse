MORE ACCEPTABLE
Should I feel an obligation,
To show a concern expressed.
With a proclaiming of a caring.
Or can I do the best I can...
To ensure my concerns are heard,
As I make every attempt myself...
To undo that which keeps me stressed.
Will a sharing of that depression felt,
With others equally identifying with it...
Find me more acceptable.
As I...
Also embrace and delight in darkness.
And this is what those who sit in darkness,
Wish?
