REFLECTIONS OF JOY
The flower in the garden smiled-
The multifarious birds when chirped
When given alms to an ill- clad
Or received an infinitesimal unexpected gift
They all gave joy
Some flickering, some solidifying
But all eroded in distant horizon
None remained in eternity.
What glitters now are reflections
That sometimes gave joy
Indeed made the day
Their degrees, qualities, quantities varied
Did the same event fetch every time the same joy?
They escalated, became zero, decreased
The everlasting joy of reality
That abides in selfless services and creativity
Which freely stand as monuments of ageless intellect
Monuments of its own magnificence
And will be ever things of beauty, the joy forever-
Admiration, reverence, tributes always hostility never.
