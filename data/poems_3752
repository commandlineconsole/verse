LINES FOR YOU
Just a mark of care
For the one's of one land
The ravishing care
Seeming your nature of life.
Something dares my care
The ruthless development in you
Further your unseen future
Avoids the mark in my care.
Your avoidance of roots
Matured standard of living
Mistakes me for your care.
I wish you to return
To the rules of nature
Your nature to our nature
The everlasting feeling of past
Indeed true standards of living.
