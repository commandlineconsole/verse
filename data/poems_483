A POEM ON FANCIFUL PASSIONS
The flowing currents
Of sheer savage passions
Awakened a forgotten era
They gate-crashed
To unlock the flow
Inundating whatever
Came their way
Directed yet directionless
The passions recklessly danced
The glow-worm passions
Settled on the night-skin and
By morning turned into
A bouquet of fresh flowers
Secretly nurtured and bloomed
Within a loving and longing heart
