STILL AND SICK AND FEEL AND I
i am still here; yet
i can still feel your touch
i can still feel your lips apon my neck
you hand apon my back
you core apon my core
and through out my hole life i have waited for a time like this
where some one like you would come and i would resist
yet though your kisses i did not resit
through your lies and transparent care
i did not resit
i should of resisted because now
i can feel yout lips apon my neck
your hand apon my back
your core apon my core and i did not resist
you said before you left 'tell me because i care'
but do you really care? do you realy care?
yes i did not resit so my voice is silenced
by me. i did not speak i did not break free
i am ashamed of who i have become yet still you say i care
you care
you care
i am still here
i sit here with my cards that hold my thoughts
what if everything you see me as is a lie
you would not care for if you did care
i would not feel your touch
i would not have felt your lips apon my neck
your hand wouldnt have been apon my back
my core would be free of your core
yes its true i did not resit so what you did i allowed
but you should have cared, and never asked
i lost my hope
i feel so sick
youe smell still lingers here
and what happens next time will i resist! ?
what is the difference between your lies and your care
how do i even know you wont resist them
why do i get lost in side this walls of self distruction
this maze that i set up for my own protection
collapsed and now this is my own exicution
i feel sick
i lost my hope
yet
i can still feel your touch
i can still feel your lips apon my neck
i can still feel your hand on my back
i can still feel your core apon my core
and i still cant breath wtih your smell of deception
or is it care do you really care?
then why do i feel sick
why do i not resist
why do i not protect my self
why do i still feel sick
why do i not resist
why
why
its because i can still feel your touch
