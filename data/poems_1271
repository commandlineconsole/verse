MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
tonight i have a good image
when mom and daughter finally meet at the airport
somewhere in Chicago
she brings her favorite goodies
from the Philippines islands
once a year, once again
the bonding begins
she teaches her what happiness brings
she tells her stories about what missing is all about
she is taken back to all those years of her youth
she edifies her goddess of love
inside the house the talking of their own language
can be heard as a chatter of two strange birds
outside it is snowing
inside the fire begins to burn
and the young children watch them
awed, amazed, delighted, so delighted.
