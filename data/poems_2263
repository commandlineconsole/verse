A CAUTION TO REECE KAY
you may consider this:
we become extinct because of anger, we kill other people's dream,
we forget
we too need to dream, and without dreams we become extinct
anger extinguishes dreams
this is the caution
this site may love dreams too of other people who simply want to dream
and it does not want anger because anger kills dreams
now you are angry and you must suffer,
to extinction you become and you cannot be heard
because now nobody listens
goodbye,
scream in your posts, no one minds reading you anymore
demand an explanation
no explanation shall be written...
