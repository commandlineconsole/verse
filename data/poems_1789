TREASURE
Where my treasure shall I store,
What shall it serve me,
If I place it behind a locked door,
What good would that be.
What of my earthly treasure,
It is not mine,
It can only give temporary pleasure,
For Lord I am thine.
I place my treasure with thee,
Where my heart has gone,
That is the place to be,
Earthly treasures I want none.
In Heaven is my treasure,
To walk with thee,
This Lord is my pleasure,
That is where I want to be.
