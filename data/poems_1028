JUMPING FOR JOY
I am jumping for joy
Every cell in my body
Is jumping in joy see
O my dear on your arrival
And in your presence
Here in this house of mine
I am wrong to say
This is mine house
No no this is not mine
This is entirely yours
My dear I am just for
Some moment staying here
As a guest
Guest of honour
I am in and out
With your breathe
I love you and I am
Intoxicated in love
In joy.
