WHERE ARE THE EASTER PEOPLE?
Like a gaping hole in the rocks it lies open
The tomb has been empty for two thousand years
But they insist on putting him back each year
To produce him again on Easter day, Surprise!
The risen Lord is always among them, Surprise!
To listen to the liturgies would you ever know?
That week by week hour by hour minute by minute
He lives within the body of believers always, Surprise!
So here we go again retelling the story as though its now
Fixing in the worlds mind this is just an ancient story
Re-enacted annually to remind us of what or who?
Can you hear the weeping in the wind of the spirit
Can you feel the challenge of the risen one now?
Tell the story but live the truth ‘Christ is Risen’
‘He is Risen indeed’ Surprise!
