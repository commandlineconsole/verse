EVEN THE PURITY OF THE SNOW
Even the purity of the snow
could not tell me
if
Eileen is happy
or she is crossing the land of sorrow?
Even the purity of the snow
could not tell me
if humanity
means happiness
or it is but a land of sorrow;
If humanity needs it own humanity
or
this is it, the time of great sorrow? ? ?
