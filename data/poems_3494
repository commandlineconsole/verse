ON THE DAY OF RAMZAN
On the day of Ramzan
Muslims all over the world
Completed a month of
Fasting-throughout-the-day
More than anything else
They enjoyed the pleasure
Of being kind to others
Of being concerned with the welfare of the unknown
Of availing the opportunity of giving
Of reaching out to help the poor
Of having understood the pains of others
Of sharing whatever they have
Of discovering new ways of being useful to others
Of feeding the fast
Of capturing the gains of fasting
Of being considerate and passionate
Of being resolved and determined
Of having felt the oneness of humanity
Of realizing the worth of healthy eating
Of loving and caring
Of knowing not pain in giving
Of knowing what all they gain is only for giving
Of giving without being asked for
Of recognizing that giving is joyful, and not holding
Of having stepped ahead in the spiritual path
Of enlightenment and thus enlightening others
Let others too
Learn this art of giving
So that the future world
Finds a humanity
Enjoying a harmonious living
In peaceful co-existence
Every one appreciating the concerns of
Every other one
