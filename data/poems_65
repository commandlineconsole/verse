LOVE ISN'T...
Love isn’t…
Love isn’t always love letters and love notes
Love isn’t just love poems and love quotes
Love isn’t always at first sight
Love isn’t just created over night
Love isn’t throwing rocks at her window
Love isn’t always easily rekindled
Love isn’t just a walk in the park
Love isn’t always feeling that “spark”
Love isn’t going out on a date
Love isn’t just believing in fate
Love isn’t just singing her a song
Love isn’t always meant to be strong
Love isn’t just being her first kiss
Love isn’t always so bliss
Love isn’t a late night call
Love isn’t catching her fall
Love isn’t giving her flowers
Love isn’t being with her for hours
Love isn’t just making love
Love isn’t always all thee above
Love is often the little things
Love is pushing her on the swings
Love is watching her when she is asleep
Love is when she makes your heart leap
Love is moving her hair out her face
Love is when she makes you chase
Love is staring into her eyes
Love is holding her when she cries
Love is glancing at her lips
Love is grabbing her by the hips
Love is holding her close
Love is when you want her the most
