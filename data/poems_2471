ANGER.... WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ME?
Anger isn't just a feeling, an emotion to detain. Anger is an action that desires the true intentions to burst forth from their towers and let be to roam about for it's own destiny. An action so precise that it with holds the power of concept of it's own imagination to soar. An action so horrid that an army has to refrian it's actions to stop before and 'accident' must occur. But is it an accident? If you purposely try to harm the uninnocent, and morely to the innocent, is it still just an accident? There are two sides to this question..................
Yes, because anger can build up for almost an entire life but one day it will break free and sometimes at the wrong person atthe wrong time in front of the wrong people. These accidents can come out completely wrong and then you are left ashamed and wit-minded. Whomever pushes the buttoms of a very ppeaceful person is only asking for trouble so therefore, no one expects any one to sit in a corner and take all of the stress with out acting out. It is just unsafe and unhealthy to the person itself!

And no it is not an accident because most people can control their temper, it just depends on te person and the moment it takes place in and the amount of anger excluded. The human temper is short, but once you go that short distance, you can sometimes hold out for awile longer. And once you notice that your temper level is getting too high, you tend to act on it by doing something regretful towards either the person causing the anger or the wrong person in general.

So anger is just more than that of an  emothion, it is a feeling and an action. It only goes soul deep.......
