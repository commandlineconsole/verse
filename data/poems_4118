FEAR
Fear is when a child asks you to keep the light on because he thinks there are monsters under his bed
Fear is when you wake up in sweats from a nightmare
Fear is when a teenager hits his father's car and doesn't know how to tell him
Fear is when you're sitting in the examination hall waiting to see the paper
Fear is when when you lose your family in a crowd
Fear is when you pull your sleeves down  so nobody can see the scars
It's when you turn the music to full volume so that no one can hear you cry
Fear is when you're forced to face a person who wants to destroy you
Fear is when a girl is afraid to lose the guy she loves
Fear is when a guy can not sleep at nights when he knows his girl isn't fine
Fear is a distressing emotion aroused by danger, evil or pain
Fear is the emotion that makes you weak on your knees
And can overpower you in seconds
Fear is just an emotion
Overcome it and you're the strongest and bravest person alive.
