BOOMERANG
Anger a  Boomerang destructive..
To self own itself an enemy afflicted
Never can anger bond with the opponent
Instead can acquire grudgeful resentment
What else than being angry, angered then..
A thought of 'why' could be
Erratic, errorful itself On self own
Than on others erratic, errorful
O'dear friend
Attest, can any one errorless..no
Pray thereso by self's conscience
For no anger, no sin
O'dear friend
Attest, can anyone erroless...yes
So if there, pervades then love wholesome
A Boomerang constructive sans anger
O'dear friend, you decide on a Boomerang
Constructive or destructive..
