STREET OF SORROW
It's time to wake up, stand up in any given city
It seems the lights have all gone to bed
and the rain pours hard into my mind
and then it hits me
move so fast, rain drops pass
left standing dry with dread
Bury the story, suppress the sanity
Moving down the street of sorrow
No street lights, kick againt the stones
walking down the street of sorrow
Another given moment the cauldren boils
and then the slag begins to rise
The moulten Mass pours on bended knees
Impurities melt and burn away
Pray at last madness pass
There is always one who'll bleed
Bury the story, suppress the sanity
Moving down the street of sorrow
No street lights, kick againt the stones
walking down the street of sorrow
