U STILL THINK I CARE? ? ! !
You still think I care? ?
When I know I no longer do
You were a memory in the past
That took the pain and sorrow with it
And got lost
I never wanted to lose you
I always wanted to be with you
But now I no longer care
About you or about your life
I don't care who you like
I don't care who you love
I don't care who you want to live with
I don't care if you want me or not
It's your life
Live it the way you want
It's your life
Take it and go far way from me
It's your life
As long as I'm not yours
You broke my heart
I put it back together
And throw away the piece that liked you
'cause I don't want you anymore around
That's all what I want to say
That I really don't care
I don't love you anymore
I don't want you anymore
So do you still think I care? ? ! !
