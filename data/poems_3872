LO SIENTO
My God
Lo siento
That You feel
That I don't love you
But the true is that I love you
My God
From the botton of my heart
My God
Lo siento
That You know
That I am not taking good care of myself
That is almost true
Because when I am not in stress I feel that I take good care of me
But when I take good care of me I take better care of my health
