PRAYER PROMPT PSALM 40:  LET ME DELIGHT IN YOUR PLANS
Thank you for the miracles - dear Father
They come as small and big gifts
Around us, are many good people
Next to us, is You
I delight in your blessings
I delight in the challenges
Everyday I get excited because
Though I'm poor and needy
You are my help.  You are our help.
You will shower us light, joy and abundance.
St. Anthony, pray for us.
