MY DEEPEST FEAR
My deepest fear is not that i am fighting
feelings that are outrageous
My deepest fear is not the life i live that
shadows me with my faults and faults of others
My deepest fear is not the fact that i am lost to
world full of cruel and unusual incidents
My deepest fear is not the false things that come
my way such as indications and judgments
My deepest fear is that i am blessed beyond measurements
and the truth of the life i live may come forward in the end
