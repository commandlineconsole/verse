FEAR MONGERING
The favourite weapon used by some Governments is fear and they use fear in many a different way
The fear of torture suffering and death and the fear of terror we hear of every day
And it's sad to think that people do believe them and believe everything that they have to say
The World is ruled by those expert at fear mongering by ageing men who in dyes hide their gray.
The weapon of fear is a powerful weapon the war lords use it to justify war
And the death of enemy civilians them doesn't seem to bother their lives are not as important as ours are,
They say they were our enemies though they were civilians and their deaths in some way we can justify
It's not our fault if a few of our bombs missed their targets in any war civilians also die.
Fear mongering nowadays is a lethal weapon and by powerful and ruthless people it is used
To undermine in us our love of others that is what happens when power is abused
They cause mistrust and mistrust leads to hatred and by them the fear of terror it is spread
And war and suffering and death is inevitable when propaganda to the flames of fear is fed.
The weapon of fear is a lethal weapon and power corrupts and men abuse their power
They prey on our fears and our human frailties and the flower of peace it is a decaying flower,
Upon the flower of peace they spray their poison and war and terror from them all we hear
And not much chance for love and harmony amongst people when the men of power use their weapon of fear.
