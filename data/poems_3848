I'M GONE
This is a disaster
Everything moves so fast
Eyes can't focus forward
Stuck too far in the past
A knife in my side
A razor to my wrist
Breaking down just once again
To cut I couldn't resist
These colors
They all fade
Only red is what i see
Flowing down
In a cascade
You don't care
You never did
You treat me like
I'm just another kid
You don't care if I'm gone
Or if I cry
You don't care what happens
So watch me die
This is over
So I'll set myself free
You don't care what happens to me
So dead is all I'm going to be
