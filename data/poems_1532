EPHEMERAL PLEASURE
Eating and get enough of it
Shortcut to h***
You live scars of life
Enjoyment small like a seed
But you produce outcomes big as an elephant
Ephemeral pleasure
You live dirty stains, unwashable
In a minute I end my life
They search and find
It was only because of you, you!
Ephemeral pleasure
Boom! It's done
With one sound you die
Like an ephemeral insect
One moment I get the incurable disease
You live the history saying
It was only because of you, I say you!
Ephemeral pleasure
