FEAR'S TAKING OVER
I fear life,
I fear death,
I fear happiness,
And everything in between.
I fear people,
I fear animals,
I fear rodents,
And everything in between.
I fear what I don't understand,
Shit, I fear what I do understand,
I fear what noone understands,
and everybody believes,
And everything in between,
Most of all I fear tomorrow and whatever it may bring.
