A GROWING WOMAN: FROM THE ARCHIVES
what i want in
public and in
few words....? ?
Keep the
pleasure
and the pressure
on....
it takes time
to cut across
this beautiful
limestone....
and that is where i need
pressure...
and if i see a nice
cracking
in the stone
i feel an incredible pleasure...while
i am keeping
the pressure
to last
for so long....
