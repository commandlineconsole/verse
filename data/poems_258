LOVE
Love and be loved
For love knows no bound
There is no holding back with love
It is freedom to the one who loves
Love and be loved
For love does not cause a thing
Love has no limits
It gives all that it has
Love and be loved
For you have nothing to lose
love does not doubt, it pays all it dues
Always on time, all the time
Love and be loved
For love is not new
It is of old, ancient of days
It is the beginning
It has no end
Love is
Love was
Love always will be
It does not flatter
It is not for sale
Love has no agenda
Love does not rage
Love and be loved
No matter the age or the stage
For love does not matter your age
Love will meet you at any stage
Love is never late
