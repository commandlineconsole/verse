TEARS
Tears are the dew drops of heart
it emits in two circumstances
first when it gets pain
second when it gets pleasure
the tears of pain
makes other to weep
the tears of pleasure
makes other to enjoy
the tears of sonority
makes a melancholy song
acculturate the significance pasture
the tears of silence
is a wisdom vow
the tears renerrate
rendezvous of serenity
of heart and soul
moist through the breathing air
fluent flow of muffing eyes
menopause the riddle life
tears are not to be wasted
more valuable than life
keep the tears preserved
within the eyelid
do not allow to come it out
it fertiles the heart
with a blooming life.
