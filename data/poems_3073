NEVER AGAIN
Let thy sorrows be mine
Let thy dreams never die
Let there be a castle of hope
Let your determination become a rope
To make you swing to the heights of sky
With my wings you learn to fly
When life will become easy and cozy
No worries, no regrets but all rosy
Then I will need these wings back to fly
To shed my sorrows on your shoulders to cry
You be my support  then ever and ever
Let thy sorrows bother you never and never
