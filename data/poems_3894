MY HEART
I now have a broken heart
from when i tried to give it to you
although I didn't know
you would never care for my heart
now I don't know what love is
I had thought we loved each other
but I was wrong
I cared for you
but you didn't care for me
I just wanted you to be the guy
who would really care for me
but not all things you want
means you will get
