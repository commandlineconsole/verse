TO LOVE AGAIN AND REMEMBER
To love again and remember
~
To love again and remember
The joys of a youthful laugh
The whispered words of lovers
The giggles and private jokes
Each kiss stolen when possible
A smile as you say beautiful
The curl of the lips raises up
What little joys remain kept
The touch of anotherâ€™s hand
Holding tightly not letting go
To be in love again and remember
Every little private pleasure
In the heart which is singing
All the joys of being in love
Aloud and in secret it is clear
How happy it is to remember
The joys of a youthful laugh
Private jokes and kisses stolen
Smiling through whispered words
Eyes looking into each other
Oh to love again and remember
