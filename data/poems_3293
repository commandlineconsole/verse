HEALING CONCERNED
I’m not concerned of death no more
However swifts it’s claim
The death of Christ, laid wide life’s door
To praise His holy name
I know! The Living God can save
Can heal body and soul
Can raise the dead from out the grave
And make them fit and whole
Its though the faith He’s given me
The hope of things to be
The joy one day the face to see
Who set my spirit free
Free as the wind free as a bird
As peaceful as a dove
Soaring on Jesus’ every word
Singing sweet songs of love
I’m not concerned if God will heal
Prolonging life on earth
I’m more concerned His love to feel
His grace for second birth
I’m not concerned how long one lives
I’m not concerned how well
I’m more concerned the truth He gives
Can save a soul from hell
For God’s ordained we all must die
No flesh will see His face
Yet through the blood of Christ on high
We’ve hope of life though grace
I’m praising God and Christ His Son
The Spirit of Life within
I’m praising God for all He’s done
My life and health to win
