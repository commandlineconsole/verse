ANGER
Anger is a livid crimson.
Anger sounds like hail furiously pounding on a tin roof.
Anger smells like singeing hair.
Anger tastes like horseradish, its bitter burning never leaving your mouth.
Anger looks like a forest fire leaving a smoldering nothing in its wake.
Anger feels like the stabbing pain of a thorn bush clutching you in its eternal embrace.
