WHY SHOULD I CARE
Why should I care what state we're in?
Why should I care if the world doesn't spin?
Why should I care when theres no food to eat?
Why should I care we kill for more than meat?
Why should I care about my own kin?
Why should I care who we fight if we win?
Why should I care when theres nowhere to sleep?
Why should I care when the drugs run deep?
Why should I care when all the children are dead?
Why should I care when a mother is raped in her own bed?
Why should I care when people scream in pain?
Why should I care when tomorrow will be the same?
Why should I care when they shout racist remarks?
Why should I care when theres no more green parks?
Why should I care when the sky has turned black?
Why should I give something when I get nothing back?
Why should I love you?
Why should I care about the world?
Its quite easy actually......................
If I don't who will?
