NEVER THOUGHT
I never thought I'd be with you
Never thought we'd ever meet
Never thought that you would fall for me
I never thought any of this
Yet, life is full of surprises
I never thought that you would be important to me
I never thought I'd feel loved again
I never thought we'd ever be close
I never thought you would ever come my way
I never thought anything because life is full of surprises.
