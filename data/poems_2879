ALONE
Alone
Iâ€™m alone now
Where once was joy, now only shame
Before, joy was my hearts companion
Captured in a rings eternal symbol
Now its failure my shame
Where once was contentment, now only sadness
Before I knew the future
Children ran before me on the path
Now only the names of ghosts linger in sadness
Where once was kindness, now only anger
Before darkness fled easily and soon
All that turned to ash in one brief moment
Now her remembered kindness brings anger for its absence
Where once was love, now only pain
Before our love was strong and true
In her I though my soul had found its mate
Now the space where that love has gone holds only pain
