SCULLION
Maid she was employed
Saxon blithe and blemish less
Amiable, emotions steepened
Just for his pleasure pause
Not to be of any other cause
Friends may scoff
Anglo –Saxon was she?
White skin has its charms of tough!
Don’t know do we?
Just for his pleasure pause
Not to be of any other cause
Smitten though soft skin silken
Eyes rounded and open wide
Expresses silent presence of passion
Just for his pleasure pause
Not to be of any other cause
