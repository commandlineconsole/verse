YOU ARE THE DREAM
Glowing, glowing all over, whispers,
whispering in my ears, touching, feeling,
sensation, promise, promising, expectation,
supersensitive, skin satin, feather-light  touch,
feeling everything, delight, delighted, delicious,
delicate, immense, the sense of touch, tactile,
delight, mouth, lips, chin, skin, cheeks, brows,
ears, eyes, chest, ripples, senses, listen, listening,
your voice caressing, your voice, adoring, seeing,
your eyes, feeling, growing, waves, texture sound,
intermingling, inexplicable, touch…
You are dream, you are vision, you ethereal,
can’t be real, beyond earth - immaterial, feeling
real, more insistent and urgent, fire, incense, burning,
tense, magnificent, you are the dream, you are the
vision, the feeling, the tactile soul, the spirit sound,
you’re in it, I’m burning, fire spreading, never-ending,
the bridge you built, your hand for me, clutching me,
setting me free, I’m floating, I’m turning inside out,
the fire exploding, the burning waves, churning,
simmering, no breathing, no more being,
dissolving into energy - EXPLOSION…
