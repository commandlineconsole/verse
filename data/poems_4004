CARE?
So what if they don't care,
what does anybody care anyway,
I'm tired of worrying,
I don't need this right now.
I 'd rather be alone,
with nobody at home,
then to care if they care...again,
Everybody's fake nowadays,
Everybody lies now and again..
So what if i'm ugly?
So what if i'm beautiful?
Like it even matters anyways?
who cares nowadays?
Would you push me down the stiars,
nobody really cares..
anyway..
