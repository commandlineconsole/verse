SINCERE FRIENDSHIP
Friendship is a sheltering tree
Where grows flower of love
That extend it branches
Like a bliss of heaven above
For friendship is a rare gift
And a source of pleasure
That brings fun and joy
More than any treasure
And it is like a garden
Where grows grass green
Just like that in friendship
There is nothing mean
And friendship is unselfish
And it is also kind
that brings you alot of fain
And pleasure's peace of mind
because it is a sunshine
That gives it bright light
And makes everything gloomy
In the garden of delight.
