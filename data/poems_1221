MIST
If I walk into this dazzling mist,
this mist of confusing delight,
would it also be known that,
to whom it might concern,
that it is merely so simple,
as to brush away the moist air,
in order to see what would be,
behind that which we refuse to see,
ourselves
So when you follow through,
into this dazzling mist,
this mist of confusing delight,
would it be known that,
to whom it may concern,
that they'd better build a bridge,
it's quite a steep ridge.
