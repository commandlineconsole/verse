I LOVED YOU
I loved you like the crashing waves love the turbulent gale
I loved you like the seagulls loved the soft sea’s lore
I loved you like the mountains love the rippling vale
I loved you like a drowning man loves the nearby shore
I loved you like sunset, like sunrise, like dawn
I loved you when it was right, even more so when it was wrong
I loved you when you were here and yearned when you were gone
I loved you in the eve, I loved you in the morn
I loved your happy eyes, I loved your angry mouth
I loved your creased forehead, I loved your disquieted doubt
I loved your pointed ears, I loved your reddened nose
I loved your warm hands, I loved your frostbitten toes
I loved the way you loved, I loved the way you spoke
I loved the way you walked and the way you said my name
I loved your sleepy baritone, I loved your every joke
I loved who you were when with me, I loved who I became
I loved that even when you yelled, I couldn’t help but love your words
I loved that when you said goodbye, it was so real, so unrehearsed
I loved that when you walked away, there was nothing I could do
But what I loved the most was that I learnt to stop loving you.
