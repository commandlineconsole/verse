SINGING SORROWFUL SONG
Why hearts all sing sorrowful ditties,
Why nightmares torment dreams pretty,
Why sorrow revels in fate’s kitty,
Why sorrow humbles joy’s uppity,
Why sorrow questions joy’s sanity,
Why sorrow encroach joy’s city,
Why sorrow disrobes nubile pity,
Why hearts all sing sorrowful ditties.
