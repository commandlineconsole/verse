THE HAPPINESS OF DEATH
He leaned in and kissed my forehead
He whispered
Tonight my dear you will cry no more
I have seen that you have suffered
Unable to bear the pain
I am calling your name
Well done my servant
Tonight you will be of perfection
In a perfect world
Leaving behind this world of sin
Tonight the heavens will celebrate your arrival
They will rejoice the saving of another soul
Tonight my dear you will reach your goal
Cry not tears of sorrow
But tears of joy
For tears of sorrow hurt
Be not sad to leave
Leave this sinful nature behind
For a better place await
Tonight marks the date
I will see you, my faithful servant at heavenâ€™s gate
My child
My child
Cry not
