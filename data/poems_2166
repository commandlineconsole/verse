THE CAT REMEMBERED ME
Long after I had stopped living there
I came back to the house to see my ex-wife, my ex-family.
It was a warm sunny afternoon
And there in the overgrown grass of the front yard
Sat the cat who we had inherited from my Mother
When we move into the house years before.
He was very old and I was surprised
To see him still alive.
I was surprised when he recognized me from a distance
And came over yowling rhythmically as he came
I sat on the stoop
As the cat wound between my legs In greeting.
Then sat with me
Two old men in the afternoon sun
At  peace in the company of each other.
