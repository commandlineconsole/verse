DELLIGHT OF BLENDED HEARTS
Joyfully frolicking intimate feelings of blended hearts
Do they embody love, sweet aches or offshoots of delight?
The aesthetic bliss of hugged hearts
Is it cooling moonlight spread by full-moon?
Or fragrance of half-bloomed jasmine buds?
Or pleasantness sprinkled by the togetherness;
Are they swiftly flowing streams?
Climbing and energetically descending water-falls
Or incessant waves of joy striking ceaselessly
Or delights of innocence?
The thoughts of nearness woven by love bond
Are they roaming deer in the valley of dear-hearts?
Or are the embodiments of the softness of butter and petals
And are replicas of the garlands of love and affection;
Joyfully frolicking intimate feelings of blended hearts
Do they embody love, sweet aches or offshoots of delight?
