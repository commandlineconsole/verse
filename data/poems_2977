KNOWING SILENCE
And every Silence has a knowing
And every knowing has a Wisdom
And every Wisdom has a sorrow
And every sorrow has a kingdom
And every kingdom fear will follow﻿

But if the fear one would swallow
Then their kingdom is not in sorrow
For their sorrow stops with Wisdom
knowing Silence is their freedom﻿
