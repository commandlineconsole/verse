NO ONE KNOWS
no one knows the pain i endure to make them happy
no one knows the lonelyness i feel
no one knows how hard it is to go to school when you're not wanted
no one knows what i am
no one knows who i am
except me
i'm beautiful
i'm shy
i'm mystical
i'm magical
i'm everything you need
i'm healer
i'm lover
i'm mother
i'm child
i'm sad and i'm lonely
because no one sees the quality in a girl like me
no one knows the potential i hold
no one knows the power i have
no one knows how good i am when you need someone by your side
no one knows who i am
no one knows what i am
except for me
and i look at myself now with pity
not for being lonely
not for being unwanted
not for being unseen
not for being unfelt
but for the deep, deep sadness
that lurks behind my eyes
for the eyes that hold
knowledge beyond their years
for the eyes that are sad
but shed no tears
for the eyes that will some day close
never to open again
it's the sadness in my heart
the sadness in my soul
the sadness in my entire being
that swallows me whole
it's this deep, deep sadness i pity
for no one knows the sadness i have
nothing more
