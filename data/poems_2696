ON THE HILL ABOVE MY HEART
I can't wait
I can't wait
for the waiting to end
to feel devoured by your return
what on earth have I missed
what have I missed of earth
soft fertility
soft cavities
of the twin serpents of your mouth
the flower that has flowered each night
on the hill above my heart
I may be waiting for nothing
but sadness
but sadness
but sadness
you may arrive with nothing
you may be nothing
you may feel nothing
you may feel like feeling nothing
how will you carry sadness in your hands
how will your hands be sad
when they are from heaven
filled with simple things
clutching at the sleeve of memories
you know what I mean
you mean what I know
you say my name
in spaces
on nights
in silences
as we walk through doors
that melt us
make our eyes gaze
on what words cannot speak
on the hill above my heart
