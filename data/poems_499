SCARLET YESTERDAYS
Magical starlit nights
Passions float taking flight
Cream-colored blossoms cover
Scarlet moments of two lovers
Mimosa tree graces the hill
Sensual desires Overpower will
Recording every lover’s passions
As countless moments fashioned
Loves forbidden fragrant dance
Permeates the air they breathe
Leaving shadows of romance
Echo's of lovers past still weaves
Scarlet yesterdays whisper
A seductive forbidden love song
Her senses soar, he leans to kiss her
Melting passions engulfs all wrong
Complex desires of fleshly emotions
Mimosa blossoms and starlit nights
Intertwined two lover’s deep devotion
Creating magical rivers of delight
Morning breaks and Secrets hidden
Scarlet moment’s only memories linger
Gentle breezes whisper of a love forbidden
A Heart carved from a lover’s finger
