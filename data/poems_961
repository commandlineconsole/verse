I WALK AND SING IN JOY THE SONGS OF OTHERS
I WALK AND SING IN JOY THE SONGS OF OTHERS
I walk and sing in Joy the songs of others
I have no mind for a poem of my own –
How can Exuberance be so useless?
I long for a poem as justification-
I write in my mind words like these
And feel I love my own Poetry –
But now there is Doubt
And the song of my own
I write to sing
Sober and serious
Demands its correction
And is rewritten and rewritten again
In a Silence without Joy.
