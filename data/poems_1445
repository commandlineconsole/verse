.PLEASURE FOR PLEASURE
Her hand is as soft as my touch
Her lips are as red as my heart
Nothing can compare as much
Pleasure for pleasure will surely start
Moments of madness end with Love
Kindness and compassion know not hypocrisy
In my mind's eye I see the Lord above
Pleasure for pleasure knows not jealousy
Solitude is made perfect together
Silence in each other's arms is sure
Escape from this world is a wish we share
Fantasy made real in pleasure for pleasure
