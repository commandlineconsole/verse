CARE
When I see how you
Care for me ~
I become Careless and
Carefree!
For my less care is
Taken care of
By the free care you give me!
For every dropp of tear I shed
You give me a thousand reasons
To smile: -)
When you say: ‘Take Care’
I know it is not merely in words.
Your caring gestures show
Your love and warmth for me
And for such Priceless,
Precious Gifts of Holistic Care
My Heart sincerely feels ~
Thankful and Grateful to thee.
