SORROW
You catch me watching you,
your laughing smile inquires what I'm about,
I say nothing, but my heart is full of wonder,
at the depth of sorrow in your eyes.
Sorrow endured, sorrow outlasted,
sorrow overcome.
Your eyes sparkle now
with a rich and resonant joy,
bringing awed silence to my
humbled heart.
aka Taliesin Flynn
