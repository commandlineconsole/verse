SCREAMS
Anger, burning up inside
Monster, growing more powerful with every word
Control, dreadfully slipping away
Myself, slipping into the dark corners of my mind
Darkness, swallowing me
Light, showing me my flaws
Death, beckoning me to
Sorrow, strangling my throat
Screams, suffocating my voice
The mirror, showing me the monster’s face
It was always there, the monster
It was always there, the anger
The anger made me sick inside, it made my stomach turn
It made me do the things I said I’d never do
It made me into the person I said I'd never become
I try to restrain it, but it has a mind of its own
Anger is a parasite, anger is the monster within
Waiting, watching, for the perfect moment to take control
