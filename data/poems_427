DO YOU WANT TO DANCE
Do you want to dance
when you're alone
in front of all your fears
with the passion
of a tribal ritual
to make it all better?
Do you want to dance
together
in front of them
with the passion
of believing
all you need is love?
Do you want to dance
when you feel you're whole
in front of their eyes
with the passion
of dancing on their heads
with negotiation?
Do you want to dance
the last dance
outside of your body
with passion,
sweat, and desire
on videotape?
Do you want to dance
the first dance
inside your body
with the passion
of romancing the cosmic connection
with the rest of your life?
Do you want to dance
like a candlelight shadow
in front of the questions
with the passion
of listening to
the childrens laughter?
