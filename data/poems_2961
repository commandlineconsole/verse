A MEMORY
Trapped in a land of shadows,
rise the incessant tides rushing into coves of sanctity,
thrashing in wild fury, destruct now the present,
a thousand veiled disguises, remembrances of sorrow and poignance,
stand strong oh seeker, life goes on with thin paper smiles and innocent sorrows,
rain arrows on my bleeding heart, give me melancholy to write symphonies from,
Why have you laid your heart bare..?
Hide behind the mountains open stare,
weep in tender agony, embrace sorrow as thine own mortal,
hold thine hands and cover thy heart,
let the rain fall and feel not sorrow,
rise and depart alongside shadows...!
