AFRAID OF THE BEST
I am afraid of this, though be my best
A cause of great concern
Will I see you soon or ever again?

I fear my best shall fade one day
And watch my ways descend
To an unfavorable end
I know my dreams were not always golden
But still they were of my chosen
This vile world has a say
In what you want to do today
I only hope my best will come again
To keep me in lifeâ€˜s lost lane
And shield me from this vile I now fear
