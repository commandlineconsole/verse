MONSTER
Darkened Dreams of the Monster in me
Praying for things I shouldn't be,
Hoping and fearing the end to be near
Hoping and fearing sweet sorrow to hear
Sensing the loss not yet gone
Feelings inside I know to be wrong
The monster inside keeps praying for pain
Disappointment felt again and again
Darkened dreams of the monster in me
Praying an end not belonging to me
Praying sweet sorrow would fill my heart
Praying the monster in me to part
Another day maybe, the Monster promised me
Another day I might be set free
Hoping and fearing the end to be near
Hoping and fearing sweet sorrow to hear
