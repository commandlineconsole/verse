BROKEN SAINT
I’m a man so religious yet so full of trouble
This world I’m afraid is all squeak and bubble
I’m trying to part from the wheat and stubble
What a row they kick up to be sure
The Salvation Army now I delight in
For the coin of the realm I’m always fighting
I love the poke bonnets when others are slighting
And bright eyes my heart will secure
Then oh me this is a surprise
Of the saints with sins I have been advised
I suppose it was all on account of your eyes
I’m settled I’m done for I’m sure
They said I had something to do with abduction
That to the girl’s parents I was an obstruction
And now in the court they make such a ruction
They are making it hot for us all
I’m as deaf as a post but I can’t help but seeing
That people are just aren’t agreeing
Illuminati army a fucked lot of beings
I’m afraid we shall all go to the wall
Then oh me this is a surprise
Of the saints with sins I have been advised
I suppose it was all on account of your eyes
I’m settled I’m done for I’m sure
The worst of the job will be in the pocket
The flats they will round there’s nothing to stop it
When it comes to that it’s quite a time to pop it
And keep what we can in our hands
They gave their money we gave them salvation
To buy their own togs was our admiration
And drove men fucked for the next generation
With our flags and our shitty bands
Then oh me this is a surprise
Of the saints with sins I have been advised
I suppose it was all on account of your eyes
I’m settled I’m done for I’m sure
They say that the girl was kept from her mother
We dodged her about from one place to another
And sent her to sleep with something or other
In a place where she had no right to be
They say this is a house not a chapel
Not where Adam or Eve stole the apple
But a more likely place to kick up a rattle
Where the saints and the sinners are free
Where the saints and the sinners are free
Where the saints and the sinners are free
Where the saints and the sinners are free
Where the saints and the sinners are free
Supposing they send them packing out of oakum
And dry bread are fucking bad kokum
If they are guilty I hope it will choke them
Halleluiah I’m sure they won’t cry
For the cat will be let out of the bag now
Old salvation tables are being moil row
With faces as long as the side of the bay now
And a mother fucking tear in each eye
Then oh me this is a surprise
Of the saints with sins I have been advised
I suppose it was all on account of your eyes
I’m settled I’m done for I’m sure
Then oh me this is a surprise
Of the saints with sins I have been advised
I suppose it was all on account of your eyes
I’m settled I’m done for I’m sure
Where the saints and the sinners are free
Where the saints and the sinners are free
Where the saints and the sinners are free
Where the saints and the sinners are free
WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE
WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE
