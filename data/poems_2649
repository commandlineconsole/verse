IMMENSE LOVE
I feel very lonely and depressed too
Although, as I have decided I will not let sadness capture me
I will think of love, even though I do not have it
Sadness, cannot capture me
Even though, I do not have anybody
Imagine I will of sweet love
As I do know, how sweet love can actually be
It is love, which I will think of
Love, sensual love can blow senses
Cannot capture me, sadness you are going away
Love, sweet love is so great
Since, sweetness can blow the heart
With love, immense love.
