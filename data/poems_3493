SEE THAT LOVE GROWS
See that love grows
Naturally blooms and flows
As it is gifted by god
It must be thing of joy and not with concern or load
Love may, at one point, look a symbol of sex or lust
But as age advances it develops into mutual trust
It brings couple together and starts liking first
Anything else becomes secondary as crucial test
It is predominantly a human feeling
It has full consent with complete willingness
Two souls merge with honest combination
For duration of happy and long relation
Nobody can deny existence of such bond
It is divine feeling and person becomes very fond
Longs for particular person and express desire
Some times he may succeed and sometimes fired
It must happen and sometimes may not happen
As desire is emanated naturally and not hidden
Same is the situation with female partner
As in such a game both may be new beginner
Love flows in its own stream
It reflects even in spare time and in dream
The dream comes true and results into reality
Both love to unite and make life worth with humanity
Life is short and must be made meaningful
No one can be termed simply successful
Unless he has lived it to full length with motives
Even though he may remain concerned with and selective
