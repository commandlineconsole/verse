I LOVE IT I LOVE YOU
I do not know what it is
I do not like to know who you are
I just love it I love it
I just love you I love you.
Not going to history
I love it I love it
No antecedents
I love you I just love you
Loving is my only alternative
I love you I love you.
Color no matter
Size no matter
My dear I addressed you
My dear I love you
I love you I love you
I love it where are you.
I know you are my only love
Nothing is there besides you
Anywhere at any time my dear
I love only you I love you
I care not whether you
Love me or not but I love.
I love you I love you
I am offering you I am giving you
What I have past present and future
I love you my dear I love you
I desire nothing I like everything
I love it I love it I love you I love you.
