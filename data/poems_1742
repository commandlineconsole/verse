VAMPIRES
Shadows of the abyss
moving in the darkness
of the moonless night
feeding on the defenseless
Misunderstood
feared
and viewed as monsters
only if you fear eternity
The masters of seduction
all knowing in the arts of pleasure
tall
and very dark
Yes they stalk you
only to seduce you
hunt you down
only to gift you with immortality
Run if you wish
but ill stay
take the small pain
for an eternity of pleasure
I donâ€™t fear the darkness
I roam under the moon
the stars are my guide
and you are my prey
Or will you be the one to stay? !
