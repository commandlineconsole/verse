CANCER
The demons inside
clutched me hard
Fear for my life i did
Fear for my soul, hid
Fear only fear
All else the demon made rid
For i had what i fear
Fear to tell my patients dear
Fear for any willing and not
to hear
I remember it well
my day
As i  looked upon my office
filled with syringes and stethoscopes
The place where i lost all my hopes
Far too late
i found out
A time where i had nothing at all
My family long gone,
divorced
Ironic it was i thought
as i breathed my last
sigh of life
free from ill and strife
I was the one who treated others
but could not for myself at all
Pain ravaged me
no treatment ever worked
the symptoms, i recognized
but did not want to believe
alone in my bed i was
no family nearby
it saddened me to know no one cared...
Three years of life
my colleagues said
They were wrong
