WHY IS LIFE UNFAIR?
Why is life Unfair?
We give and never receive,
We grab and never appreciate,
My concern was so much about life's glory than burdens,
Life is bad for most people are not faithful,
I have seen it all in my struggle's,
Handling a favour does not make the love,
For mostly we are living unjust,
Why life is Unfair?
Many never appreciate all you did,
Many will never see you as a Being,
Many are selfish for all their concerns,
Life is so Unfair,
Life is not just,
Since everyday people die,
Never apprecaite the birds, the trees, the animals,
Life is Unfair,
Many burst and kill,
Life is Unfair,
Talkin bad about me,
This is not fair at all.
