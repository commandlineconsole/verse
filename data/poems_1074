DELIGHT IN THE DAY
Delight in the day, as the sun shines o'er,
as the birds sing in their hushed and quiet praise.
Delight in the warmth, where the rain falls no more,
where brilliant sunlight kisses the summer days.
Delight in the earth of our heavenly sage,
where the flowers, their bright, joyous petals blend,
when the years have disguised their tenebrous age,
with the hands of our master, our guide, and friend.
Delight in the memories of times now past.
Delight in your loves and your heart's sacred keep.
For, love is honored and ever shall it last.
Love is the bellwether of our dreams in sleep.
Delight in the day, as its raptures resound,
among the clouds, the grass, and the blue-sky screen.
Behold the paradise of love all around,
dancing with the wind across the verdant green.
