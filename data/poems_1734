THERE IS SO MUCH PLEASURE AND JOY IN LIFE
THERE IS SO MUCH PLEASURE AND JOY IN LIFE
There is so much pleasure and joy in life,
The world is so rich in so many good and interesting things,
Life can be so happy and so wonderful in so many ways,
There is no end to the miracle it can be-
Why then?
Why then?
Weary, stale, flat, unprofitable-
Do I sink into a depth of darkness
From where I know
There has never been true light
And never will there be- life again?
