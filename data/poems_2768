MY SADNESS HAS COME AND HAS COME TO STAY
Before that sunset when the darkness comes
My heart cries for my folly that made me dumb
Like that fight of a soldier with an empty gun
My wishes are to see her before I go down
My sadness has come and has come to stay
O my Lord take me! I can’t survive before I die
I know I’ve done nothing, I know I made her cry
Imprison me my Lord! You don’t support lies
She was born for me but I was a born a fly
My sadness has come and has come to stay
This apology of mine can’t kill my arrogance
If I was brave I wouldn’t match her intelligence
She was that queen to cure animosity
Now I should blame only my ignorance
My sadness has come and has come to stay
My fears and my cries, the torture of her past
As I couldn’t protect when she needed me at night
My love and my joy, only reminds her of pain
If I was a teenager I’d say, I was insane
My sadness has come and has come to stay
Love should be for those loving each other
And shouldn’t be for those laughing at each other
When she loved me I laughed, that roused her anger
And when she cried I joked, that caused her departure
My sadness has come and has come to stay
If I should die now, I would like to be the first
As I have left nothing behind, I better go to rest
She deserves a good life, she deserves the very best
She needs a good man, and they’re all in the west
My sadness has come and has come to stay
