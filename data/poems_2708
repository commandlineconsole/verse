DANCING TO THE SOUND OF OUR TEARS
Gentle and sweet
Sad and strange
Tears sting my eyes
The music plays
The feeling that there's something more
The strangeness of thought
Of love
Of me
For sadness and pain,
hatred of sympathy
The answers unknown
The questions unasked
Sadness is close
But it's destiny
It's pain unleashed
But in love melting sadness
The music plays on
That sad gentle notes
The next part is wrong
But I know it's alright
My love,
The end is in sight.
And even though
Sadness brims
There's a peace to its song
One that calms me and says;
'sweetheart,
It can't be that wrong'
Yellow and gold
That strange sad tune
Playing it's gentle notes
While we slowly dance to the music
Like children, moving to sway
Dancing to the sound of our tears
