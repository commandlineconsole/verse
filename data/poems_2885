WELCOME 2009, LET HAPPINESS COME, AND SADNESS TOO.
you welcome happiness and success
then you must also welcome the ugly ones
and sadness
with equal lengths of your arms
i think, in life, that is fair enough.
there shall be no forced happiness
there shall be no denial of sadness
welcome all, say yes to everything
what is there left for us to choose?
