DO NOT FEAR ME
When you see my glistening eyes...
When you hear my untamed songs...
But above all...
When you see me surging through to wild,
But do not fear, for I shall not harm you.
When you see my lethal teeth tearing the elk,
Feel no fear,
For I shall never hunt you.
When you feel my fur brush aginst the civilization,
Do not fear,
for I have my own territory to wander in.
When you see others pick up their guns,
Fear for me...
for they hunt me.
When you hear the baying hounds,
And the crack of the gunshot.
Remember me.
But until that day comes,
Do not fear me,
for if you fear the wolf,
you may destroy me.
