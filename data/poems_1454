PLEASURE CAN BE PAIN
Pleasure can be pain
Pleasure can be a game
Pleasure can everything
But when you find it
Everything will change
I thought I wanted pleasure
But it changed my life
All that I thought wasn't true
They lied, it felt horrible
I just didn't know what to do
So I ran away
And never turned back
Because all that had happened
Was in the past
Pleasure can be defined in many ways
But this way is not the same
