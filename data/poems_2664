LIFE'S SADNESS DOES NOT FADE
Life's sadness does not fade-
It grows greater in time-
Older and no wiser
We weep for our earlier days,
And remember all we have lost
And have not been-
So much has happened
And we have achieved so little in it all-
And so much Beauty and Goodness is gone
And so many people we loved.
Life's Sadness does not fade
It grows greater in time-
Older and no wiser,
We play our games with words and thoughts and feelings,
But the Sadness remains and grows.
