PLEASURES
We look high and low for life's material treasures,
While overlooking some of everyday's simple pleasures.
So much of life goes by without personal reward,
Because we fail to look inward instead of toward.
Fulfillment of dreams is a fleeting goal,
That can only be found by searching deeply into one's own soul.
So enjoy the simple daily pleasures,
And, you will reap the greatest of life's treasures.
