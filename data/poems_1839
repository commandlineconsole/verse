I COULD TELL
I could tell from the smile that was missing form your eyes
when you looked at me,
I could tell by the way you acted surprised when
I entered the room,
I could tell from the way you hastily said,
I'm busy today, could you come back tomorrow?
I could tell you were cheating on me,
I came by to surprise you but the surprise was on me.
I could tell from her face when she came out the shower,
that she was surprised to see me as much as I was,
surprised to see her,
We could tell from the look on your face that you
knew you were screwed,
You were playing us two, but listen up player,
the joke is on you,
We had a little talk and guess what?
Both of us are through with you!
