SIGNS (11/1/11)
Now you're over her
And as far as I'm concerned,
There is no 'other' girl
Or is there?
You've been asking me
If I'll wait for you
You've been hanging around me
More often than usual
You've been asking who I like
And if there is another boy
You smile and laugh at my jokes
But that's nothing new
Even so...
It still makes me smile
I'm starting to believe
That these signs
Are more than what they seem
Please, please prove me right
