LOVE SONGS THAT ARE HERE TODAY (A LYRIC)
Love songs that are here today
Maybe all gone tomorrow
Time is a challenge play
In to the hours it will borrow
Nowhere to go but here
In our destiny on
Something that is somewhere
Till it's all gone
You and I love to stay
Blissfully on a pleasure row
Waiting for times to weigh
What there shall soon go?
Why is there some year
Youthful in a happy run
And then it's a lonely tear
Without those pleasures fun
Love songs that are here today
How awesome they can come
Nothing forever to stay
Only for a moment some
Yesterdays that gave its steer
Into the summer sun
Are some now long gone year
Into time's weaving spun
