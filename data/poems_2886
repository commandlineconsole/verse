HEALING HEART
Shattered heart forced to heal
as greatness unveils thine soul.
Hope whispered in the distance,
to recover thine lost love.
'Tis night brings tender passing,
healing thine soul with glorious blunder.
Caus' not one or two,
but dissipated nights of dreams.
Sadness comes to end,
happiness conquered hate.
Love sprouting - sadness shrinking,
hope has come again.
