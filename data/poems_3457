COLOUR WITHOUT LIGHT
Is there colour without light?
Our eyes experience colour
Through motions mathematical
Imagination creating colour
Sense to sight through light
Mathematics, beauty and truth
A trinity that bind complexity
Yesterday, Today, Forever
Time began at a time chosen
Out of nothing comes nothing
Physics mimicking theology
Searching for the mind of God
Theophany found in being
Flows on within and without
Invisible made visible
Unknown until known
Deceptive concerns hidden
In environmental gravy train
Spinning policy made reality
Gravity of lies disturbs
Genuine concern primed
Engaged and distracted
Haarp exploits the ionosphere
Destructive waves pierce space
Synchronised thought control
Swinging from high to low
Arsenal of weather weapons
Primed and ready to go
No longer science fiction
Hidden in plain sight
Natures voice neutralised
Green was once a colour
Masks provided for collusion
Pride conforms softminded elite
Electric cars and carbon footprint
Handy phrases sipped with wine
Bottle banks never redundant
Drowning with sense of superiority
Proud self-wisdom blinds
Spoon-fed a diet of percentages
Counterfeit words fill the air
Fear serves politics and illusion
Softminded in all but conformity
Dressed in mocking sincerity
Disengaged behind detachment
We care for the world, whilst
Turning away our neighbour
Lipservice paid in pious liturgy
Shades of darkness in the night
Prefer knowledge to wisdom
There is no colour without light
