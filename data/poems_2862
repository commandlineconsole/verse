WILLOW TREE
I look at you with sadness in my heart.
Oh willow
where did this sadness truly start?
With lamenting songs it stands healthy,
very strong inside my heart. Your beauty always growing so strong
remains within our souls
where it does belong
Your presence in this world
does make its beauty mark
