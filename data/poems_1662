A GARDEN OF LOVE
In the intimate hand of marital bliss
In the inner sanctum of divine ecstasy
Within this sacrosanct garden of love
Where pleasures abound night and day
Where two come together as one flesh
And boundaries and limits torn down
Creative intimate expression displayed
Here, one is stripped and unashamed
Truly denuded and yet not embarrassed
Emotionally uncovered but not recoiled
Unguarded and exposed without refrain
And at the deepest level of vulnerability
Lay the unimaginable intimate pleasures
In the most delectable frolic of foreplay
Contemplative and festive yet playful
Exhaustive and yet tender and exotic
Culminating in the sweetest embrace
In a breathless passion of completeness
In earnest quietude of restful euphoria
And with a quiet prayer of thanksgiving
