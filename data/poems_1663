RAIN FALL
Carefully listen to the sound
Of rain that is falling on the ground
For it has so much magic in it
That gives you pleasure bit by bit
So listen to this tune with cheer
For in it is hidden the prayer
The prayer and the blessings of God
Who is the creator and the Lord
And try to understand its rhyme
For it has awakening echoes of time
That can bring you pleasure and joy
To dive in its beauty to enjoy
So carefully listen to this sound
That is ebdlessly falling on the ground.
