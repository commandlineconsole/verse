VERLAINE
'The sensitive violins of the fall are hurting my heart'
said to Mendes with regret..
'monotonous sorrow in my heart! '
wasn't he the one
who smashed the love he had
with the back of his hands
everything faded...
the clock stroke...
for whatever he cried after, it wouldn't be enough...
the prince of the pets who said
'sorrow, an endless sorrow melted me'
was so much like a naughty child talking
even if all his friends broke up and fell apart
water and soil
rain and fog loved him...
wild blowing storm sorrow and love..insanely...
wanted to express himself with this mistakes...
and in the midst of a naked loneliness
closed his eyes for the eternity.
