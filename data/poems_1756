THE DAYS OF OLD
There is an ancient magicians theatre
Where the pleasures of the past still linger
But when you look, at first sight
It only looks lost and tethered
There are posters on the cracked walls
Showing wonder and delight
But when you look at the faded colour
They bear the mark of  the eternal night
Inside you can hear the magic man’s laugh
And his black moustache
Hiding his original face,
Forgetting the man within disguise
Then you see a lonely black rose
Dry and vulnerable with change
Yet, the rose still lures your attention
Although it has lost all its charm
When you leave the ancient magicians theatre
You still see the ragged old sign
You’ll see seats of pleasure
And feel the presence of father time
