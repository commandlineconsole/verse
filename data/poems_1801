WITH YOU
In a crowded world, why do i feel so alone?
In a crowded world were this emptiness no worldly pleasure atone.
I have pursued pleasure and foolish am i to have seeked rest in a race
And right there u were, right in front of my face
So i come to you all worn and blue
For now if wishes were horses i would rather walk...
Walk with no one else...
Walk with you.
