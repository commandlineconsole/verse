STAND ALONE
stand there in the center of the room
filled with pain and hater
trying to hide it behide a smile or some joke
it like laughing the outside
but dieing in the inside
seeing all the stuff gone wrong in her life
all of the sadness is endless
pain grows deeper  and hate come out
fairy tales  and true love is the one
things she dosen't  believe in
to end the sadness
her life is the price she will pay
