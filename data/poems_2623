EMOTIONLESS
No Love,
No Life,
No Pain,
No Peace,
No happiness's,
No Sadness,
No Hate,
No more can happen to our fate,
Emotionless some people stand today
No Love,
No Life,
No Pain,
No Peace,
No happiness's,
No Sadness,
No Hate,
No more can some one be held in arms and feel the love,
and release the hate,
No more tears to cry,
All is to live for,
Is the day we die,
No Love,
No Life,
No Pain,
No Peace,
No happiness,
No Sadness,
No Hate,
No more but its all Fake
Emotionless is how we all stand today.
