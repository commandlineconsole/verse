DISASTER
Fire burning inside me
The pain is overwhelming
Heart beating faster,
Life is a disaster
How can I breathe
To see my faith crashing down
to see the light turn to the darkness
To see me drowning in the waves of fear
Chorus: Disaster, Disaster
That's all I hear
Disaster, Disaster
Take me down with fear
Life is never going to be the same
Help me oh help me oh
Help me now,
to stop my life from crashing down
Disaster, Disaster
That's all I hear
Disaster, Disaster
Take me down with fear
Disaster...is what I fear
To see me fading
under the water
To see me drowning
in the waves of fear
Disaster...Is what I fear
