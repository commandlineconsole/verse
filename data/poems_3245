SHADOW
My shadow falls behind me
as I walk towards the sun
It's always there when I need it
and I know I'm never alone
Traveling long and hard
on this road with you my friend
When I think I've finally made it
I see I have to start over again
Walk with me shadow
on this road without an end
Through happiness and sorrow
you're my only true friend
So many have forsaken me
some say they're true friends
But you have always walked with me
and you will until the end
You have never told a lie
or ever done me wrong
You guided me through sorrow
for which has made me strong
