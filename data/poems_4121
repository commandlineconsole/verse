THE FEAR__
I want the fear,
because it's comforting.
I need the fear,
because it doesn't need me.
I love the fear,
because it hates me.
I stay with the fear,
because it leaves me.
I captured the fear,
because it escaped me.
I feed the fear,
because it make me.
The fear controls us,
the fear is our weakness.
the fear is a sanctuary,
the fear is hell.
I want the fear,
because it's comforting.
I need the fear,
because it doesn't need me.
