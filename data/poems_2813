THE SAME TEAR
Can happiness and sadness
Be in the same tear
I believe so
The feeling of pure greatness
Happy as ever
The tear wants to shed
But when the feeling goes
Happy is over
Sad kicks in
Yet the tear has not fallen
Then the emotions collide
Creating a liquid diamond
Wasted to the ground
Can happiness and sadness
Be in the same tear
I believe so
