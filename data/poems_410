PASSION FOR LIFE
A passion for life
A passion for souls
A passion for life is all I'm asking for
Lord give me a heart, as tender as yours
A passionate life is all I'm asking for
Jesus You are, the one who redeemed
By dying on Calvary's cross just for me
So set me on fire; set me ablaze
With a passion like Yours, till the end of my days
