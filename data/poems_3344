RELATIVLEY SPEAKING
Discerned, he rose again
From a feathers bothered
Bristle

In-between the weight of places
To which men gasp in vice

He concerned himself
Only in measure of Newtonâ€™s Law

Compound in what it was
Failure depends
Only if he wished to be tickled
By old Isaac
For taking too much of his time

Discerned, he rested once more
Prior to the feathers bother
Bristle

The general relativity was
The bold line between where

Hearts beat
And where man takes plunder

He concerned himself
Only in measures to that which had parented
the previously stated

From there
I stood up with my gift,
The feather,
And proceeded on my path
