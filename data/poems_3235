BLEED TO BREATHE
Bleeding to stay till tomorrow,
Bleeding to erase the painful sorrow,
Bleeding to live in peace,
Bleeding and crawling on wounded knees
That's how I left you,
That's how you were,
It's when you called my name,
And you knew I would never be there,
You begged me to stay,
You know I would if I may,
It's my unforgivable reward,
I knew to my life you would rehold,
Hereto far the sorrows and pain
Won't leave me
Hereto far I begged you silently
To forgive me,
For the sins I have made,
To step out of the shade,
To feel the beauty of life again,
To wash away all the gained pain,
