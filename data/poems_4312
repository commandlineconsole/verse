THE FEAR WITHIN
What should I do?
What can I do?
When the fear within is killing me.
I cant sleep, I cant dream
I cant think, I cant scream
Because the fear within is killing me.
I feel like weeping for ever
I feel like sleeping for ever!
Because i feel the fear within will never die!
What is this fear?
Why is this fear?
And why is it killing me!
The fear spreads like cancer
But i cant find an answer
Why is the fear killing me!
The best thing i could do
And the last thing I should do
Is kill the fear  before it killed me!
