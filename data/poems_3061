TIME
it's time
yes it is
it's time
to end this
the night has come
tonight not tomarrow
the night has come
filled with sorrow
it's over
nothing more to say
it's over
this game you play
the day has come
today not tomarrow
the day has come
to end this sorrow
it's time
for the end
it's time
my friend
no more tomarrows
no more sorrows
no more game
no more blame
it's over
no goodbye
it's time
to die
