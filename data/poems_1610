PLEASURE IN PAIN
The outburst of my first cry,
Made my mother realize,
That the daughter born,
In this world to experience,
Pleasure in pain…………..
As I crawled on the hard rough floor,
My mother adored my tiny legs
With heavy coiled anklets without beads,
To ensure I suppressed all,
The aspirations without sounds,
Pleasure in pain…………..
I grew and held the support of a wall,
To stand and walk,
My mother with amusement,
Tied up a string around my waist,
As I learnt to be within limits and never caused disgrace,
Pleasure in pain…………..
I now looked around for birds and butterflies,
I jumped up to high to catch and to fly,
My mother with great admiration,
Entrusted the kitchen ladle and pan to fry,
All that my life would begin in small smoky kitchen,
With saucepans and tears hidden,
Pleasure in pain………………..
I loved to sing, loved to dance,
Even tossed pages of my brother’s book,
My mother with high appreciation,
Taught me to make bread and tea,
To serve all with bending knee,
Pleasure in pain……………
My world, my friends locked within the four walls,
Some hanging in the kitchen, some under the bed,
Broom stick, mop stick, kitchen ladle, and tea kettle,
Made me feel as a kitchen angel,
I outburst, my cry, my pain and my love
Went unnoticed by all, except the lifeless companions,
Who heard my voice, who wiped my tears, who laughed with me although,
Made me feel pleasure in pain…….
That has no gain,
With the burden of strain,
As a girl, as a woman,
My aspiration rests as a dream come true,
But in vain, but in vain…………
