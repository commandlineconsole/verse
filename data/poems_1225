LIFE'S KIT
The air is lively
And very bright
Everything feels
Full of delight
Because everywhere
Sun is shining
And in every cloud
There is a silver lining
So get up now
And enjoy it
And know that
In this life's kit
Everything is there
You have to pick
Joys from here
And then for you
The air will be bright
And you will feel
Its joy and delight.
