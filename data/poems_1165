GREY DAY LIGHT
oh cloud so milky white
bird of such high flight
blue my eyes, wash their sight
now bespeckled by your light
glowing wilderness of night
in summer when I might
chance upon oh fresh delight
whimsical chaos oh contrite
presenting cloud oh so milky white
forboding rain to dim the light
grey
oh when will my vanity take flight
leaving my soul to take delight
in the sun, light is but different shades of
grey
