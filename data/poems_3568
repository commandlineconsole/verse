LIONS AND DOVES
Lord Jesus, teach me to turn
contempt into concern,
curses into kisses,
hate into love,
lions into doves...
Lord Jesus, you know
that, deep in my  heart,
there is not much real love,
that I still curse, and still hate,
and that my lion growls at my dove...
Lord Jesus, what can I do
with all the gifts I'm asking from you,
unless You teach me first of all
to use those precious gifts
in true humility?
