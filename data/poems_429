THE PASSION
i have the passion
it is a manic lyrical thrust
into another dimension
u look at the sky and go
BUST BUST
thats all there is folks
i have the passion
it is my magic fingers
of the latest sensation
u look into my heart and go
BURST BURST
i have the passion
it is my unmatched vision
of the world gone off fishinn
u look my mind and go
SOB SOB
I have the passion
it is the ability to transform
the earths health in motion
you look into my soul and go
YES YES
i have the passion
it is the insight to create
life its self in orderly fashion
you look into my eyes and scream
GOOD GOD
you now have witnessed
the passion of a supernatural being
i am no God i am no demon
look up at me as though saying
i am yours
take my soul on and on
for you i will create love
now never forget
i as fly off like a dove
tell nobody of my existence
or i shall leave this world
as you hopelessly seek to be my witness
remember my words poor human
you damn your race as soon as spread my love
write no bible, forge no martyrs
life is more precious than my image
never speak of me, until you soon find me on mars....
