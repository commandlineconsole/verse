WITH YOU
When I’m with you
It’s a whole new world
You don’t judge but praise
You don't demand but request
You let me be as I please
With you
Trust is reciprocal and
Love is magical
With you
Pleasure is all around and
Inspirations so profound
When we come together
We venture further
Into the wonderland of each other
In the darkness and in the light
The courtship only delights
The passion fires
Hot springs boiled
Thunders roared
Lightning strikes
Sizzling rain poured
As the pleasure ripples from the core
All the glory is restored
With you….with joy….with dreams….with life….
