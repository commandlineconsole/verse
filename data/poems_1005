LISTEN AND HEAR
Rain, Wind,  Snow
Water dripping (from a faucet)
Love, Sadness, Madness, Anger, Joy
Tears of Sorrow
Tears of Joy
Tears of Anger
Tears of Moy
A child laughing
Giggling, prancing, dancing about
A child laughing, a child playing, a child
These are the things that I will miss
These are the things that make me cry
These are the things that fill me with joy inside
These are the things that make the world go round
These are things
Things are these
Listen
