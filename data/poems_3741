WHAT WAS THAT 'CRACKING' SOUND?
I don't care that my best friend skipped without me.
I don't care that her foster brother's violating her totally.
I don't care that my brother's a liar.
I don't care that my father may actually be dying.
I don't care that the 'right' people hate me.
I don't care that my work's going to waste and nobody sees it.
I don't care that nobody seems to care today, and my heart was Broken accidentally.
Like I said, I don't care.
I wish.
