EPIGRAM ON WOMEN AFTER AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO JAMES MATHEW BARRIE
Oh the goodness of their goodness when they're good,
and the prudeness of their prudeness when they're prude,
but the goodness of their goodness, and the prudeness of their prudeness
are as nothing to their lewdness when they're lewd.
Oh the lewdness of their lewdness when they're lewd,
and the nudeness of their nudity when viewed,
but the lewdness of their lewdness and the nudity of nudeness
are as nothing to their prudeness when pursued!

Epigram on Women
Oh, the gladness of their gladness when they're glad,
and the sadness of their sadness when they're sad,
but the gladness of their gladness and the sadness of their sadness
are as nothing to their badness when they're bad!
Oh, the shrewdness of their shrewdness when they are shrewd,
And the rudeness of their rudeness when they're rude;
But the shrewdness of their shrewdness and the rudeness of their rudeness,
Are as nothing to their goodness when they're good!
Amos Bronson Alcott  also attributed to James Mathew Barrie
