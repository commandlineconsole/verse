I LOVE THE WAY YOU ARE
i love you
i love the way you talk
i love the way you say my name
i love the way you laugh
i love the way you say 'i love you'
i love the way you misss me
i love the way you say im your girl
i love the way i carry your spirit with me
i love the way i miss you
i loven when we get to talk
i love the way you make me smile
i love the way you are
i love the way you make me laugh
i love what you say
i love you each an every passing day
i love you more an more
i love you, though it may seem so surreal
believe me, i love you
