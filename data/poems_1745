TEMPTATION
Drunken Bliss
Midnight kiss
Black winged grace
Night's sweet embrace

Liquid pleasure
Darkeness with no measure
A sea of sheets
Where bodies do meet

Lips do part
In this physical art
The sweetest of sins
As minds and bodies give in

Sweet temptation
Pleasure that exceeds imagination
Things only the darkness knows
As the fire within grows
