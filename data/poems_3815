HE IS MY ANGEL
He is like everything anyone could imagine.
He is like everything i would dream of.
He is like everything that anyone would want.
He is my angel
The one who looks over me
The one who takes care of me
The one who listens to me when i need someone to talk too
The one who hugs me when i cry
The one who kisses me when i wake up in the morning
He is my angel
Takes care of my heart
Takes care of me
Takes care of what i do
Takes care of me when i'm sick in bed
Takes care of me when something goes wrong
Takes care of me when something bad happens
He is there for all my needs and hurts
That is my angel
