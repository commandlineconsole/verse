A PARADOX OF JOY...
a boy was hurt
but he could not just be a boy forever
a man too is hurt
but he could not just be a man forever
and so the hurt or whatever you name it
pain, grief, trauma
psychosis
or simply sadness
with the poetic twist of a gentle lamentation
cannot be forever that boy or that man
there is something divine in all these
gifts as you may wish
there is something that polishes that rough stone
turn it into a very precious diamond
like the story of the clam and
its pearl
that sadness exist
but sadness cannot be sadness forever
hope, that is the wish
there is no permanence in all of these
wait, from this door to the stair and to the horizon of a black line
someone comes, it is something bringing everything for you
exalt, exalt
in extreme silence....
