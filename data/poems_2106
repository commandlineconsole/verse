SURPRISE ATTACK
The enemy can be easily way laid in night
When they are relaxing after the fierce fight?
They won’t have slight inkling about surprise move
They may not have slight chance for superiority to prove
The olden battles waged by kings provide sufficient skill
How the war can be won and force the enemy to flee or killed?
How best the weaknesses can be exploited to full advantage?
And the best and powerful armies of the world can be managed

The ground is surveyed before the start of war
The enemy supply lines are too probed very far
The cut of supply route can bring any army to knee
They may loose the clear advantage of fighting free
The rulers never wanted any competion
They were guided by the superstitions
No one should challenge their authority
They must have complete superiority
The kings were sole authority in the field
They had lots of influence and enormous power to yield
They were benevolent and provided good shield
They had high standing in public eye and respect too held
The war norms were observed and not violated
At down it was bringing all the hostilities to an end
The armies would retire to tents and prepare for next day
Still the foul games were never ruled out in any way
I have vivid remembrance of one such incident
The army was annihilated and defeat was evident
The retired generals thought to make surprise attack
They had nothing to loose but everything at stake
As they entered retiring tents in barracks
They found it opportune for surprise attack
They moved at ease and killed many generals
The little carelessness proved fatal for veterans
It is known reaction with the advent of next sun rise
The whole filed will be witnessed by sudden demise
Lot many able generals might have lost their life
It was not moral war but worn torn strife
The time has changed but not the tactics
The time and against it has been proved by statistics
The powerful armies are routed by small army
The theories and proofs are provided by many
Who ever strikes first can with the half war?
Enemy may not be able to go and cut very far
It will be seen as their graveyard or coffin
They have to flee the ground instead witnessing the win
* The surprise attack is powerful weapon in any war”
