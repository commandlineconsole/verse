SURPRISES
Surprises,
They enter the spaces in one's mind.
They ricochet around
into what it means
to be part of mankind.
They challenge,
what one's ideas and feelings are there,
They allow us to go
into what it means
to be part of the sphere.
They start change
about the meaning of all  our lives.
They will surface questions,
into what it means,
what it is now that thrives.
They move one
into another type of being,
They shift rigidity,
into what  it means,
and what is worth seeing.
New movement,
hope for further development
They tempt and persuade
into what it means
to live for the moment.
Surprises
shocking maybe reassuring.
They will always seep
into what it means,
to be human, being.
