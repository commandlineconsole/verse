FEAR FEARS
Though the streams dry
And the wind blows so hard
Though our neighbors die
Our birds forget to sing
And terribly cry
Though there are no clouds in the sky
And no drops of rain touch our earth
‘Fear shall fail’ to frighten us
‘Fear shall fail’ to shake our house
For fear fears our shelter
For fears our father.
