OH NIGHT OF DELIGHT
Oh night of
delight
you were there
in dreams
fueling my
desires
passionately.
Heard you in
the wind
blowing in my
direction
catching many
echoes
whispering my
name.
Standing in the
shadows
I caught a
glimpse of you
reaching out to
touch
you made our
dreams
come true.
Oh what a night
night of delight.
