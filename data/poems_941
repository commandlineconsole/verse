HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY SAMEEN
Sameen my dear my love
I wish may happiness dove
Flies over in life's trial
To give you the gift of a smile
I love you my sweet heart
And wish for you joy's tart
To be baked with lots of care
To show how much you're dear
And today you're turning one
I wish may happiness sun
Always shine upon your life
To colour it with joy's drive
And teach you how to enjoy
Life's pleasures and life's joy
so you can always smile
And be happy in your style.
