A MISTAKE
my heart opend right up for you, was that a mistak of letting you in, was it a mistak loving you, you dont think so your glad that you loved me and cared, but somethings changed and now that care and love has burned out of you, your with your other love now, loveing her the way you loved me once,  how could you care for anyone elas i thought you would love me forever, was my heart being messed with or did you actuaully care.
