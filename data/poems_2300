WISDOM HAS ITS WAY
A warm summer's day at a freshly mown park
Hearing kids smile and hearing dogs bark
I sit and enjoy at a bench made of wood
I think about God and how He is so good.
A few yards away at another park bench
A couple were talking, as their fists are clenched
30 minutes full, of argument and rancor
Highlight their pain, their hurt and their anger.
I can only hear every second word
Among the anger and the sound of the birds
Among the shaking, of heads and sighs
Her shoulders now slump, she begins to cry.
He starts to weep in his anger and pain
Extends his arm around her shoulders again
The anger flairs up, another question she lends
I could see they were lovers, not merely friends.
Point by point, they work out their differences
Working hard to ensure their responsiveness
Will help them move on, their future assert
And heal all the pain, their anger and hurt.
Holding hands, they both walk away
Wisdom has proven to have its way
They work out their issues, pain and hurt
For patience has done, its perfect work.
