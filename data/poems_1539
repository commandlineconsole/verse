PLEASURES OF THY HEART
My Love Come to be with thee
The pleasures of our hearts will prove
Valleys Green
Rolling in the Groves and Fields
By Shallow WaterFalls
I sing to thee my Songs
Doves circle above in approval
As your golden locks unfurl
In the rose petals 'neath us
Your eyes pull thine closer
Closer to you...Not a word
Yet you speak loudly with your heart
These pleasures of our hearts
Ne'er to part
These pleasures of our hearts
Struck by the Loving Dart.
Peter LeBuhn
