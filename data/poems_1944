AS I GAZE
As I gaze at my shattered reflection,
Lying in pieces, there on the floor,
I am surprised, completely taken aback,
I see something that I never saw before.
I see a glimmer of hope,
Shining there in my eyes,
I forgot about hope,
So it comes as a surprise.
I don’t believe these scattered fragments,
The reflection in the broken lies,
So I search myself, looking for despair,
That’s quite strange, I can’t find any here.
