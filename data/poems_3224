AND THEN TOMORROW
Sun shines as I walk along
Birds sing a happy song
I have a feeling so wrong
A feeling like I don't belong
A dream of walking hand in hand-
Of making love in the sand
I hear the song of a lonely band
The rain falls as I stand
Two hearts beating as one
A love that has never begun
No more shine of the sun
And no more rivers will run
Take away the sorrow
Take away the pain
And then tomorrow
Away will go the rain
Make me believe
'Cause all I've seen
Are only dreams...
That love doesn't mean
And then tomorrow
The pain won't refrain
Away will go the sorrow
Away will go the rain
