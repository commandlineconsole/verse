PLEASURE IS PARTIAL
Pleasure is partial
You are with me
I am pleasant.
I am earning money
I am pleasant
I am getting necessities.
I am unpleasant
I am paying taxes
There is loss of money.
My pleasure is partial
Here I am in sorrow
I am suffering.
My world is moving
From west to east
And in the east
There is sun rise.
I am in sorrow
I am unpleasant
In unfavourable
Circumstances
And I feel happy
In favourable
Circumstances .
Pleasure is partial
Pleasure is relative.
