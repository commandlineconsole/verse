UNCONCERNED
It's of no concern to me, the way it is you dress,
whether or not your pants fit or your shirt matches.
It doesn't matter to me, what side of your head, you part your hair.
It's of no concern to me, whether or not, your shoes are shined, or if you
wear a tie and it's the right color.
WHAT AM I? YOUR MOTHER?
It's of no concern to me, if you don't wash your hands before eating, or
afterward. Or if you bolt your food down.
SHOULD I CARE? AFTER ALL, I'M NOT YOUR FATHER.
I'm not concerned over the fact that you are loud and arrogant, and swear and cuss too much...or that you don't have time for me.
I'M NOT YOU BROTHER OR YOUR SISTER.
It's of no concern to me, that when we go out somewhere nice,
you don't wear shirt and pants that match,
you don't shine your shoes,
your tie's the wrong color,
your hair's parted on the wrong side,
you don't wash your hands before or after eating,
you bolt your food down,
your loud, arrogant and rude,
and you don't have time for me.
You see, I am not concerned.
I'M NOT YOUR MOTHER, OR YOUR FATHER, OR YOUR SISTER, OR YOU BROTHER!
I'm only a person that loves you very much.
'How do I look? ' you ask.
'Great! ' I reply.
You see...I am not concerned.
