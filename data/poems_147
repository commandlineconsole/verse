LOVE IS HELL
love is ridiculous
love is evil
love is war
love is hell
some say they cant wait to fall in love
they wait, wait, and wait
they wait for prince charming
they love, they break, they love again
but still they wait
love is death
love is evil
love is war
love is hell
they want for someone to save them
they want someone to love them
they want someone's shoulder to cry on
they think they need love
love is death
love is evil
love is the end
love is hell
ask them what love is
ask them i dare you!
they will say 'its great'
they will say 'its to die for'
they will say 'every one needs it'
NO! not every one needs it
love is death
love is ridiculous
love is war
love is hell
some times it takes once
just once
your hole life can change
you find out you don't need love
love is death
love is evil
love is the end
love is ridiculous
love is war
love is hell
