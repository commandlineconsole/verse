LOVE IS NOT LOVING
love is not a loving thing
love is something from me to you
love does not hurt nor does it sting
love is something that keeps me true
love makes you want to sing
love is what i hold for you too
love is what i need to feel
love is something with a solid seel
love is a lot
love does not hold a solid knot
love to me is You
love is what is between us two
love is here forever something you will help me through
love is this poem
love will show em
love is not shy
love does not make us cry
love is Bye Bye
