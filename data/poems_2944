THE SORROWS OF THE SEAS
Look out at the sea,
You feel it,
But it is not the sea you feel is it,
It is but your soul,
Traped in the sarrows of the seas,
It never is but a sea,
Walk along the beach,
Cry and pray to the waves,
All you can see is but the sarrows of the sea,
Alone I sit,
Alone I cry,
Alone is but the sea,
Alone my soul alone my shadow,
It is the sorrows of the sea,
Cry to your self,
Cry to the sorrows of the sea,
I am alone,
I am alone and only I and Me know,
And the sorrows of the sea,
I am but the sorrows of the sea,
