VILLANELLE 4:  'OH YOUR EYES'
Oh your eyes are bright, gleaming specks of light,
That could pierce my soul with their radiant glow,
To behold them close is such great delight;
All that I can write, as you graced my sight,
I tucked in your book, many years ago,
Says your eyes are bright, gleaming specks of light;
And so write I did in your book each night,
All about your eyes, as I sit near you,
And beheld them close to my great delight;
But the wings of chance snatched me in their flight,
Only then in dreams can I tell you so,
That your eyes are bright, gleaming specks of light;
And now I am back, but somewhat with fright,
As I search for you, for those eyes I knew,
To behold them close with such great delight;
And your little girl, if time proves me right,
Might find in her book, someday, these lines too:
Oh your eyes are bright, gleaming specks of light,
To behold them close, is such great delight.
