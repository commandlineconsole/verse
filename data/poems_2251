ANIMAL ANGER AGAIN
The most misused natural resource is animal emotion, man
Animal jealousy, animal love, animal happiness, animal libido, man
Animal compassion, animal grief, animal ogle, animal sex, man
Animal ego, animal fear or stampede, but animal anger utmost
It is a resource of value and virtue if used in prudence, man
Least vicious off all lest ghoulish natural disposition
Whose exemplification follows below in juxtaposition;
Out of anger a human animal kills
Revenges in full feat of anger
Causing accidents and damages
In employment of anger to uphold ego
A snake will not bite until ignited to anger
But in its calm state it’s an agent of ecological peace
Lioness is herbivorous in their truce but irascibly carnivorous
Buffaloes only crash if catapulted by anger
But romantically crazy in the emotional bliss
Man is fountain of peaceful jealousy
Man is cradle of venerative bigotry
Man is a well of murderous love
Humanity engendered is matchless ocean
Of cantankerous infatuation crushing for doable
And non-doables, deservation of pity,
All these natural ornamentations
That echo vicious virtues of man
Are protégés of perfected anger, i say
