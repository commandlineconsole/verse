SURPRISE ME WITH THE TRUTH
Surprise me with the truth
Don't lie to me no more
Words no longer twisted
As they always have before
I'm not scared of honesty
Im not scared about who I am
But your afraid to say the words
Frankly I don't give a damn
But your living in a lie
Words you cannot speak
How much has changed
Strength has turned so weak
Surprise me with the truth
It will set you free
Don't lose yourself in lies
Tell the truth to me
