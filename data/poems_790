IT IS A JOY
It is a joy when spring comes
and flowers keep smiling,
It is a joy when rain-drops fall
after  so many days of earnest waiting.
It is a joy to sleep silently
putting your head in the lap of mother,
It is a joy to get your first love
in this loveless world.
But nothing is as joyful as
to be the father of a child.
