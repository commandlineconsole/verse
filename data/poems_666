FOREVER IN A MOMENT
Taking your hand
Fingers to my lips
I want to love every inch of you
Taste every part of your body
As if I can drink your love's blood
Through your very pores
I want to get lost in your eyes
Consumed by your kiss
Set my body on fire
Quench the fire in my blood
With sweet caresses
Touch my soul with your passion
Lay down beside me
Feel my body crying for you
Lets get lost in each other
Touching, tasting, exploring
We will exceed passion, go beyond bliss
For this is our time
Want me like no other
Need you, like the air that I breathe
Together, one mind, one soul
Fused in the heat of passionate love
Existing in this moment
Forever
