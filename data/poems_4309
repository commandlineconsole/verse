MY FEAR
I feel no cringe when I walk
In the empty dark that could hold shadowy evil,
I fear not the rime fingers of solitude,
I fear not the maledictions of the tongues of men
And the horned fangs and claws of any beast of this earth.
I fear not the taunting of the cunning devil;
The strength of his legions or jinxes that paralyse my efforts,
Nor do I fear the halitosis in the breath of dearth's call
Reducing life to a mere toss of a coin.
I can even stand to dare the axe of my err.
There seems to be non, still I have my fear;
I fear that peaceful lake that conceals silent people,
I fear that never ending hunger even if they call it God above.
I fear love! ! !
