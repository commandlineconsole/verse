IT IS RATHER SHOCKING TO SEE
I am not surprised at all,
That today there seems to be...
A lack of comprehension centered,
Around one's identity with a dignity not flaunted.
I am not surprised at all,
To witness this kind of environment.
But it is rather shocking...
To see pitbulls walking their 'owners' on a leash!
