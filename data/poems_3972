SOMEONE WHO CARES
Why is it so hard, to find someone who cares?
Someone who's willing to catch these tears?
It's always hard to find someone who'll be there
To catch you when you fall
Who will always answer when you call
Why is it so hard, to keep the one who cares?
Someone who you thought could never tear?
Its always hard to keep them on side
To trust them not to leave or hide
To keep themselves yours forever
Why is it so hard, coping without the someone that cares?
Someone whom without, the world crashes down, too much to bear?
It's always going to be hard, not to cry whilst remembering them
To not get lost in precious memories you both once shared
To want back the one that cared
Why is it so hard, to live in a world that no longer cares?
One that keeps on growing more and more cruel?
And takes the ones you love away
Now I have no-one who cares
And I grow worse and worse by the day.
