KISSING IN THE TERRACE
Your innocent smile capturing my heart
Your eyes calling upon me
Your lips moist like the dew drops on a rose
As the grey clouds gather around us
As they rumble and let down
Silver Droplets of passion
Falling upon your lovely black hair
To your feet cold and waiting to be warmed
Our lips sealed, we kiss in the rain
We dance in the rain,
Kiss against the wall
As the rain falls upon our entangled bodies
We lay lost and mesmerized in our world
Our hearts content in bliss
Our souls drenched in passion
As we lay
Kissing in the terrace, under the rain.
