PRESENTS
Your presents do surprise my presence,
Inside their beliefs is the same - absence.
My destruction will gain an imagination,
Too gifted is my surprise, like a jack-in-the-box expectation.
Inner worries come with flight
As much as flight of might.
The gift is too big,
It quarrels with my gig.
I may wonder for exactly a minute
How lucky I am.
