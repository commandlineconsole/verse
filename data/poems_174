ON VALENTINES DAY
On Valentines Day
Love is a tingling in your heart
That never stops
Love is
Midsummer night’s dream
And a few dew drops
Love is a mystery without a clue
Love is
To say, yes I love you.
Love is a utopia
But you can see, feel and touch
Love is a reality
That makes you laugh, cry and laugh.
Love is
Buying a rose on Valentine’s Day
Love is
A falling star that makes you pray
Love is
Rare but also true
Love is
To say, yes- I love you.
Love makes you think
Love makes you dream
Love makes you to tour
Singapore or Palmpore…
Love makes you see
How lonely a man can be
Love is to start never to adieu
Love is to say- yes, I love you.
Love is history and love is future
Love brings us close to nature
Love is Bengal and also Himachal
Love is  me and love is you
Love is to say- Shanu  I love you!
