LOVE IS
love is not a word
love is love
love is who you are
love never dies
love lyies in your heart
love is what you show others
love is inside us all
love is what sets you free
love is your heart
love is your family
love is a song
love is inside you
love is what lets people in
love is around you
you might not see it
but love is there
you just might not believe
believe in love
and love will show you the way
the way to who loves you the most
