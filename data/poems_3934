NOBODY
I may not be a famous rapper like Kanye, or actor like Chris Colfer, or an author that is world know like jk rowling.
But on the dark nights and days when you think 'nobody loves me, nobody cares, nobody sees me, nobody would care if i am here, nobody will miss me when im gone'
You're right, nobody loves you, nobody cares, nobody sees you, nobody would care if you are gone, nobody cars if you are here or there.
JUST REMEMBER I AM NOBODY.
