JACK & JILL
Fear not,
your passion,
your ridges,
your incomparable pain.
Fear not,
your desire,
nor hunger,
and un applauded gains.
Fear
the emptiness,
the platitude,
the endless monotony,
of your suburban life.
Fear the ineptitude,
that defines you,
the lack of passion,
that blinds you.
For when you die,
you will not have lived,
but rather
floated,
listless
and pale.
