I WONDER WHY SHE WROTE A POEM LIKE THAT
she starts about her conversation
with the doctor
inside the operating room
concerning her
first abortion
(how could she when she says
she was still on an anesthesia
feeling no pain at all
and she says)
'doctor, clean my womb
and remove every dirt
clean the little flesh
that may in the future rot,
and pull out everything
there that dirts
my conscience'
how could she?
how could she ever say those words?
when she had long been
dead?
