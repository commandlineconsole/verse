IT IS LOVE
It is love when your heart beats so fast
It is love when your face blush
It is love when you are happy
It is love when you are angry
It is love when you care and worry
It is love when you cry
It is love when you are jealus
It is love when you excite to see
It is love when you set him free
It is love when you forgive
It is love when you give
It is love when you sacrifice
It is love when you are hurt
It is love that makes you human
It is love that makes everything wonderful
