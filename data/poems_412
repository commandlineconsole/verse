BLUE EYED THUNDER
Beautiful blue eyes full of life
Always a smile even when
there is a lot of pain
I don't know if anyone
has ever seen the fire and passion
Blue eyed thunder that's what you are
So full of passion and life
beyond anyone's imagination
Those blue eyes are so captivating
I can't help but to stare into them
Passion for life burning in those eyes
a fire for a love good and true
All stemming from the life you live
Blue eyed thunder how can it be
that your eyes can hold in such a
Always alive with passion and love
Always and forever my blue eyed thunder
