'PASSION AND DESIRE'
Miles and miles separates us my darling.

You are there at the other end

And i am here.

Its like we are on both ends of the rainbow.

But, distance never be an obstacle

Of what we feel for each other.

We are engulfed of a magical feelings

that even the vast ocean is not a hindrance.

Everyday, I long for your touch

Each time i think of you

I am burning inside.

Every night I slept with emptiness

A void that only you, can fill it.

You got me under you skin

The flames of love keeps
burning my heart.

Thousands of miles between us

But, our passions and desires

reach each mile and covered

the distance between us.

Such feelings and emotions

boiling inside us.

A mystical forces enjoining us

our two hearts beat into one,

two bodies become one

Two minds but think one.

The passions burning ablazed with desire.

Our love aglow in the dark.

Such strong feelings and longing

for each other's arms,
that even the universe

help us climb the unreachable

heights of passion and desire.

The moment we touch, I felt like home.

Everything fallin' back into places.

I feel whole and complete.

Our bodies joined with flaming desires.

Passion that I never think exist inside of me.

Such flames can not be controlled nor frozen.

Oh, my mystical lover!
My passion is burning

My desire ablazing with fire

burning and boiling inside of my being.

Only you my love can free me in this prison

and make me submit this desire and passion

into your arms, together we will explore

the land of desires, the place of passions

the world of lust, and the universe of lovers.

Our hearts beat into one

Our minds speaks the same.

There is no distance, even a thousand miles

can stop us, our love for each other is stronger

than any hinder, we maybe far apart

but our hearts and minds reach

for each other's passions and desires.

With you my love,  forever I surrender

My passion and desire.
