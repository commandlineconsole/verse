IFF WE SHALL MET AGAIN
If we shall met again
While I walk outside inthe sidewalks here at home
I will greet you with my beautiful smile
So that you can see that I am happy
And at the same time I will hide my sadness inside of my heart
Also I won't show you my sadness
And you will never see my sadness
Because why should I be sad?
And to tell you the truth I prefer to be happy
Because when I am sad I get stressed out very fast
And when I am happy I feel more relaxed
