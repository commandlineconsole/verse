GOD'S LIL' SNOWFLAKES
God’s lil’ Snowflake
Snowflakes are denizens
Of cold winter sky
Drawn from grey clouds
To icy drifts, where they lie
They blanket bare limbs
Of cold shivering trees
Through which they swim
Like swarms of crystalline bees
Individually formed,
no two are alike…and which with,
Mother Nature, the artist
Paints her canvas of white
Each snowflake is a delight
The best of which is among
The delight in a child’s eyes
When snowflake lights on the tongue
