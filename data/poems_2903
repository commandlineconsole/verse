SOME SORROWS
Some sorrows
are like vitiligo
which never go
some sorrows
are like blisters
of burn which
cure very slow.
some sorrows
are like a wick
which burn for us
some sorrows
are like a flour mill
which churn for us
some sorrows
for us trickle
down the Cross
some sorrows
make for us
a beautiful ras
some sorrows
we can't forget
some sorrows
for us open up
a pleasure gate
Ref: here the term  ras  is picked up from Hindu mythology which means dance in circular manner.
