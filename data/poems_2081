IT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU
Ticket taker, dream maker
I desperately hope you think of me
as much as I think about you.
Your tuxedo-esque outfit
which hugs you
is lucky
because I would like to hug you all day too.
The gum you chew
probably flavors your kisses,
and I hope it is watermelon
because that's what it is
in my fantasies,
and it is lucky
because it touches your lips.
I feel my heart freeze
when your fingers touch mine
as we exchange money and ticket,
and I always try to push my hand closer
so that we can touch,
but the money/ticket is lucky
because it touches your whole hand.
Ticket taker, dream maker
I hope you think of me,
but it would surprise me if you did
in the most glorious way - it would surprise me,
and it might surprise you
that I named a gerbil after you once,
and I loved her until she died.
