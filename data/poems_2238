ANGER, AN ATTRIBUTE OF DEVIL
As the white ant eats up the wood
Anger eats up thy wisdom
Bravery doesn't lie in taking revenge
It lies in checking thy anger
Anger is an attribute of devil
In anger thou forget the difference
Between good and bad
Thou art like a devil who is devoid of virtue
Anger keeps thee away from God
For he ignores thy sin howsoever grave it is
And wishes thee to ignore the infirmities of
Thy counterpart.
