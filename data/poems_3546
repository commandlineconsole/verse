A LITTLE TIME FOR SELF
With all
The stress that life
Heaps upon us daily—
Concerns of every kind: spouse, job,
Children.
Even
The pet demands
Its share of attention.
You’ve constantly put out, but it’s
Your turn.
So take
A little time
For self. Do something that
You have always wanted to do.
Enjoy.
