LONG TRAIN RIDE
A long, long train ride,
Baby Joy is her name,
Little Jaime and his pride,
A family pet, she became.
As little Jaime grew
Awaken, he could see
and even through his tears
He saw in Joy her fears
Accepting it is best
for Joy to be set free
And that is how Big Joy
became a mommy of three!
