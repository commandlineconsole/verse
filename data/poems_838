O' WHAT A JOY IT IS
what a joy
o' what a joy it is
what a life
o' what a life it is...
my mind stands within the joy in my heart
my spirit is refreshed by the banks of the river
my thought is enlightened by the guide of the giver
my life walks within the joy in my heart
o' what a joy it is
o' what a joy it brings
my tree talks in anger to the farmer
my being walks in hunger to the farmer
my wind blows further to the corner
my hinge door opens to another
o' what a joy it is
o' what a life it means
my leaves fall in matter to the ground
my weaves call in matter to the found
my means roll in either to the proud
my deeds fall in bitter to the crowd
o' what a joy it is
o' what a smile it brings
my shoe laces shine to the full moon
my few faces smile to the new moon
my wings flew away than soon
my feathers ran in awe from noon
o' what joy it is
o' what a path it is
my eyes run in joy
my eyes cry never to a toy
my ears catch in isolation
my fears match in eye for reason
o' what a joy it is
o' what a time it is
