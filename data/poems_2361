STORM
The trees sway back and forth in the wind
The thunder rolls with anger
The rain sadly pours down
My favorite weather
A storm
An anger boiled
Buttons pushed until they broke
And hell being awoke
Reminds me of myself
A school
At home
Anger boils
I wish I could let it out
Like the storm
Raging
Inside and out
