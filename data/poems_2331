TENDERNESS
Clothe your words with gentleness
Guard your heart with tenderness
Arm your life with forgiveness
Bitterness unresolved, breeds Wrath
And wrath nurtured, brews into Anger
And anger, when it's full-grown,
Kindles and flares into Clamor;
Clamor conspires with Anger,
Nurtures herself into Evil-speaking,
Evil-speaking, adorns herself in Malice
Walks hand-in-hand with wickedness,
Into the path of self-destruction
Henceforth, seek the best in others
Hold-fast to that which edifies
Let godliness guard your life
Let friendship guide your lips
That you may be found in the arms of peace
Cuddled by the assuring hands of God
Retiring each night in blissful slumber.
