DOWN THE RIVER I FLOW
Down the river I flow
My feelings I never show
I just keep flowing along
Singing the same old song
A song of anger, A song of sadness
A song that sings of the on coming madness
Singing a song from the beginning
Yet never truly ending
Starts off with happiness
Then hits hard the pain
Next comes on the sadness
Ending with insanity being maintained
Down the river I flow
Heart full of sadness and woe
Sadness for my child that never existed
Woe for my heart being twisted
Twisted in the worst way
Dealing with pain each and every day
Wishing it would have been true
A child born from me and you
But you messed it all up
By not coming out and telling me the truth
But in your face it finally blew up
So now I flow down this river so early in youth
