THE LAST MOMENT
As I sit there to think of him.
It's sorrow now, everyone knows.
My teardrops are on my face.
My eyes are wet that I seek out new life.
Broken soul in my mind and my last moment
that I saw him behold me.
Suddently, he was gone.
Until then I hide my sadness sorrow
that I deeply hold my emotion down
and the last moment still exists in me.
