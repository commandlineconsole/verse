FEAR OF DEATH
I don't know where I have been,
I don't know what i have done,
Only a sense of deja vu hunts me,
A feeling of anxiety lingers in my heart.
A feeling of loosing evreything i have,
Feeling of lying defeated in this battle,
A sense of nostalgia  wraps me,
whole life  unwinds before me,
A feeling of leaving this all,
And going to unknown place grips me,
Fear of unknown takes away the joy of known,
I don't know but this fear stalks me,
whenever i see something nice,
I am not able to  enjoy it's beauty,
for the fear of not being able to see it again grips me,
A fear of the end stops my very beigning,
I know one who comes here has to go from here,
but a feeling of dying without living haunts me,
Fear of leaving lot of things unaccomplished,
a fear of leaving the loved ones behind and moving along,
A fear of loosing this body moving to somewhere unknown.
