LIFE MEAN TO ME IS
Life mean to me is
Full of surprised that is good or bad surprised
It can be tough or easy
Choices it should be what you think
It should be what you want not anyone else
I don't listen or care
I know you will make right one
We all have time when we mistake that we wish we haven't and take back, but
You can't because it happen when you make a decision unless you able to fix it
Life mean to me is
Going complaining, but I can overcome it
Everything going be ok
I'm losing everyone that I care and love
I feel they give up on me
I be alright again like now
I feel horrible at time
It opens my eyes and makes me think
I need to stop complaining about problems that is gone over and over
I need stop acting like I'm now
I don't care what people think of me
I have done it bad so I'm changing my way
I'm going be ok
Every day is not getting easy
I'm not going let it stop me
I am letting it turn out this way all because of you
I lost most important thing and is you
You are one who turn my life upside down
I was fool for falling over you in first place
I take it on people and I didn't mean too
I know it now than late is good
I'm starting over
It's going to take time
This summer I learned a lot about life and people
I got part of me need to grow up
Right now it in my hand
Time to reach for goal
What life means to me is
Start doing it right
I need to improve myself
I don't want to be like this anymore
Is hard enough already
Don't be hard on yourself
Enjoy life while you have chance
Take a break and have fun
You can't undo what happen already
No matter how much you wish for it
You need to start fresh and over again
Life mean to me is
