IF YOU CARED
If you cared about what I said you would realize that I am hurt and broken.
If you cared about who I am you would see that I am not who you think I am.
If you cared about my feelings you would feel that I have loved you for a long time.
If you cared you would be here right now as I lie down for the night trying to remember the warmth of you arms.
If you cared you would have never left me here alone.
If you cared I would have never been alone and wouldn't ever be.
