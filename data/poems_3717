NO REASON TO CARE
no matter how many people seem to care
I don't care
and this I can share
I don't care
if my life is left dead
I don't care
about the dark thought in my head
I don't care
about myself
I don't care
enough to leave a note on my shelf
because I'm worthless,
useless, dead
and soon enough
I'll be lying about what I've said
because when they ask
it almost seems pointless to people
because they see a perfect girl
who preys at the bottom of a steeple
they see a girl with no problems in life
one they would never suspect to use a knife
because she's quiet and she smiles
but her problems are becoming huge piles
so I don't care
if you stare at me
and I don't care
if you don't like what you see
I no longer care about anything because the truth is
there's
No Reason To Care
