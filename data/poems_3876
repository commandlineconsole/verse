I DON'T CARE.
I don't care to know your name,
I don't care to feel the way you make me feel,
I don't care to play your game,
And I don't care if your such a big deal.
I don't know why you chose me,
I don't know why I'm your obsession,
I don't know why Ihave to flee,
But I know you wont have succesion,
I'm not afraid of you,
Fear,
Wether your far,
Or if your near.
