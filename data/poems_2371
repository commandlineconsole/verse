MR. TIBBS
There is a boiler
Down deep inside
In between my heart and ribs
Building pressure
Standing by
I named it Mr. Tibbs
This Mr. Tibbs
He has one goal
One of putrid pride
Take my anger
Ball it up
Cook it till it's fried
Mr. Tibbs
He keeps strong hold
Not letting anger loose
Therein lies a problem, bold
For I am choked by anger's noose
