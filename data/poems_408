FIRE
It was once stated that fire is a sign of passion
I remember whe i set my first fire
I was everything go up in flames
I stood there watching everything I set up burn to the ground
And it never made a sound.
I found it amazing
It was better then star gazing
My dream job is to be a professional arsonist going around showing signs of passion for everything that i burn
Whether it be a passion of love
Or a passion of pure hate.
Everyone will burn one day
AND THAT DAY IS TODAY
