A REFLECTION ON MY POETRY
Writing has given me such pleasure
Yet so much pain
Our relationship begets
Love and hate
An artistic ability forsaken
I say what I want to say
Constantly giving and taking
In the end, I know I'll have to pay
I've lost more friends, relationships
Possible relationships and,
Recently an awesome one
Due to our infidelity and consanguinity
Entertainment through my pain
Around me the world keeps turning
Delighted by an erroneous pleasure
This artistic spirit keeps burning
Dedicated to all you poets who put yourselves out there for us and yourselves and have received more pain than pleasure from writing
