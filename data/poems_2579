and sad, perhaps;
as of children
visited for the first time in their life
by sadness;  pure sadness,
without friend or enemy,
just sad; sadness which does not tell
of its parents, or of where it came from,
or of where it might be going;
or of how long it might stay before it goes..
yes, sadness like that.
