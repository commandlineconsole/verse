EACH NEW DAY
Starting off, on the way
Many new burdens each waking day
Sorrows of ours draped like curtains
Sorrows of good, bad and uncertain
Pushing on must keep going
Many new trials yet never knowing
What’s in store for us next
We’ll survive someway so complex
All our thoughts and feelings you see
Soon disappear, so seeming to be
Continuing on, never ceasing
What to do, we are piecing
How soon we are to finish up
Hoping we’re not like some schlup
To the people come and people gone
Trials of life hardly done
Fast becoming what we’re not
All our feelings in a knot
Of complex thoughts and woven things
Time to go, I'm ready for more teachings
