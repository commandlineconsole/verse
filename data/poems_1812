FRIENDS
Lonely body secluded mind
you are within self
Temporal pleasure secluded thoughts
you are within soul
Lonely body exulted brain
you are within you
Satisfied body pleasant will
you are within the brew
There is someone
who sees you
No want no claim
no bully no screw
Share your pleasure
get back care
Open your heart
find some touch
Just cry out I love you
It is your friend who trurns sky blue.
