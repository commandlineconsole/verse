FEELINGS
The core of feelings
Like and dislike,
Evolve into love and hatred,
Further evolve into happiness and sadness,
Happiness leads to hopeful, liveliness ……
Sadness leads to disappointment, lifeless…
Enjoy savouring the sweetness of happiness,
Suffer painfully in the bitterness of sadness!
The core of feelings,
Like and dislike,
Exist within,
Without any choices,
Like the shadow under the light,
Tailing without rest the whole life,
Come along when we’re born,
Eliminate when we’re gone.
