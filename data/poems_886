MOTHER
A wonderful gift from God,
the giver of joy filled with joy.
She's the ultimate source of happiness,
shining the light of love filled with goodness.
A strong lion protecting her cub,
from the evil of the outside world.
A devine protector,
sent from above by the creator.
She's the great iroko tree,
spreading life to her branches in a wink.
She's the sun,
brightning the days of her sons.
I hail you! giver of joy
for spreading your light filled with love.
You have brought joy to my world,
life is felt by your devine touch.
I pray and long for the day when i bring joy to that face which has show me love since the begining of days.
I pray my wish comes true without delay.
