' PASSION(S) ... '
Passion …
A Breathless – Flight
Into Beautiful, Light
then … Floating Languorously Down
into Red, Rose Petals and Our Arms Around…
Passion …
Oh You Daring-Dancing Flames
Unashamedly Blaze
You Mesmerizing Sight
adds to This Mist-Fall Night
Intense, Consuming, Sparks, and Touch Flickering
… Gold-Glow and Warmth and Whispers, Lingering…
Passion …
not just – Romeo and Juliet or Paris and Helen of Troy
not just the Fascination of a Young Girl and a Boy
but also:  God and His Son, The Arts, and Songs, like  ‘Ode To Joy’
and Dancing and Chocolate, Ice Cream and Chunky-Chips-Ahoy’
and when I’m Writing or Reading Poetry… Please Do Not Annoy!
I’m Happy as a Child, Playing with my Pen and Paper Toys…
Passion …
I am Pliant in Its Hands … and I am Yielding to the Pleasures
of  My  Passion(s)
