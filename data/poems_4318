FEAR
Fear,
In the darkest of nights,
In the creepiest corners,
In the old webbed house,
It comes to warn us.
Fear,
In the meow of the cats
In the howl of the dogs,
In that lonely flying bat,
It makes the blood clog.
Fear,
On the night of full moon,
Or when it rains in night,
With every flashing bolt,
It gives the heart a fright.
Fear,
With every jar that breaks,
Or when the phone rings in dark,
When the wind knocks on door,
When the lights on ceiling spark.
Fear,
When an owl on the tree hoots,
When in night the horses whine,
When the shadows seem to move,
It sends a chill down the spine.
Fear,
With every slamming door,
With every creak of stairs,
It can make the heart stop,
It is known as fear.
Fear,
When it comes to stalk,
It can even kill a beast,
It eats you from within,
It can poison every feast,
No god, no angel,
Can save from its curse,
Itâ€™s the master of death,
It goes from bad to worse,
With every frightened sun,
With every threatening moon,
It gnaws in and evolves,
It will kill you all soon.
