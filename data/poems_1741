LIFE ON THE STREETS
She never planned to give birth to me
Nor did he even planned to be my father
Out of a mistake I was born
Out of marriage I was born
I was born out of the Maternity Ward
Here now I stay on the streets
Hopeless, homeless
I am without courage
My future is bleak
Begging is my normal life
Up and down the streets,
I move in search of food
I face daily struggles
I am totally abandoned
Groping in the dark
Tears rolling down my dusty cheeks
Days, months are passing in shear poverty
Some moves from pleasure to pleasure
Covered with wealth
Fully educated and proud,
And I am left without honor
If wishes would come true
