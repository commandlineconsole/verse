SONG OF TEARS
i was  born in the heart loneliness
but not in the crocodile heart
i ask for nothing but i will surf on your cheeks and sweeps your sorrows
but for her i'm special, so for me also
i know all her heart desires, sorrows, joys
others remember me only in their sorrows but not in their joys
but she calls me in her joy, lonely, sorrows
she hides me from other
and my best friend saves her
she never calls me when she gets hurt
because she doesn't want people to call me crocodile
I'm the tear who will be with you
when nobody comes to you and
i have a heart, only few people have place in it like her.
