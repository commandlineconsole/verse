(DODGY DAVE TALE)  WALTER MATHAU IN STRATFORD
So a new Tale
for Dodgy Dave here
A face of a star
A clone it appears
I'm not sure but some say it true
I had my own idea and mind map
and surprise, surprise
It's very close to this chap
They say he resembles
the late great Walter Mathau
But I bet by far
He's more handsomer somehow
(It's the size of his heart that makes us say WOW!)
For all of you who traveled to see him
How blessed you are to meet this man
The one behind the Dodgy Dave Tales
Now your more that just a poetry fan
