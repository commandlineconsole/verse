***PASSION FLOWER***
He was a young lad
Endless dreams she had
She was a flowered rose
She made all sacrifices to make him her spouse
For days, he was the Helios
Without him, she was in pathos
The white dress she wears
No matter how living; there are no fears
Love could un-shed all her tears…
Even on removing the white dress
It seems that the life was full of gladness
In the times before the wedding
Life was as sweets as pudding
Now the time of the vow has gone
She removes the white dress
And is forced into love’s black dress
The life seems full of stress
The gentleman removed the mask of softness and gentleness…
He was showing her his flair
But it was a built castle in the air
Passion Flower she has become
She bathes on a sad realm
She wears a heart of mourning
Passion Flower is crying
'''''From Zenith to Nadir I letdown
Just prayers and pleas I own'''''
Her eyes are in perplexity
All things developed to complexity
The white dress was forsaken leaving obscurity
And finished are the days of serenity and tranquility
Little by little, Passion Flower has faded away
My Passion Flower is wilted and is fading away
Little by little, Passion Flower has bowed to the sadness
Little by little, Passion Flower has bent to the faintness
Her Heaven turned into haziness
Her Bliss turned into darkness
Her Dreamland turned into fogginess
Her Paradise turned into distress
For the sake of her children she is fighting
Really now, there is no more lighting…
Pretty Passion Flower
May ALLAH send you power
To pull up your thorn
Pretty Passion Flower
May ALLAH send you power
To stay nice in your cocoon
May ALLAH send you Peace
To live your life at ease
Without any male disease...
Pretty Passion Flower please keep scenting
For the sake of your Angels, Love and care try sending
Pretty Passion Flower please don’t be withered
Pretty Passion Flower you wrongfully suffered
But, ''Pretty Passion Flower please don’t be withered! ’'
From now on he is far! ! !
Free from his pain you are…
