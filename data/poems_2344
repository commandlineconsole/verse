MY ANGER CONTROLS ME
Controls all aspects of my life
Inside and outside
There is no escape
Those who know me will
Well stay away
For my anger
I will unleash upon them
And the world would suffer with them
I give them a stare
That says plainly
'Don't disturb me or you die.'
So all my friends
Are effected by
My anger.
And in the end
I will stand-alone.
Forever in my anger.
