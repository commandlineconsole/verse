FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS  -  DEEPAVALI
On this day was the demon
Killed and virtue preserved,
When the people celebrate
With crackers, firebombs,
Cracklinf the street with delight
Eat all the sweets they can
Consume with much delight,
Gives the shopkeepers happily
Selling everything from hair pins
To luxury cars flaunted by
The ones enjoying the day
In much celebration and pomp
Hugging friends and rerlatives
All the day long for celebration
Is here for the victory over Evil.
