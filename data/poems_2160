A YOUNG PLAYMATE
As I went home from school,
I took fun in making a stroll.
Along the pavement was a gal,
Played with kids as their big pal.
She was carefree seemed innocent,
Childish countenance yet adolescent.
Something special about her gesture,
I was attracted to her petite raw nature.
Not taken slumber since that discovery,
I thought she was just only an imaginary.
But I was surprised to met her again,
Across the street bathing in the rain.
After a week of daring acquaintance,
She became my girlfriend in an instance.
It was my first time to become intimate,
With one as excited to be my playmate.
Never before I had kiss a pretty dame,
To my surprised she initiated the game.
There I stood hard as I was consumed,
By a hot lover who knelled to performed.
