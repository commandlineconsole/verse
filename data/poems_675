AS LOVE
Sitting with love on a hill,
the evening sky full of stars,
look down with the moon
As our hearts full of tender bliss,
beat as one as darkness close.
Our lips touch with burning passion,
like fire fanned by the wind.
Our hearts now beat faster
with the passions rise.
Suddenly our eyes are locked,
at one another under heavens gaze.
The world is nowhere to be seen,
as love conquers all.
