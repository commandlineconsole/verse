SEEKING FREEDOM
A blank stare gazing into my eyes
what am I,
why am I here,
where I will never be again,
Is it do or die, confusion and disarray take over my mind.
Sadness not anger fills my body for I see clearly but I hear you not.
Your breath I taste awaking my utmost pleasurable senses.
Countless seconds pass as I gaze
Aggravation, disappointment, mistrust take over the essences of my sanity
Sadness falls upon my soul longing to be free
Free from savage inhumanity
Free from imprisonment,
Freedom from myself.
