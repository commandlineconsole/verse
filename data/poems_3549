FAMILY VALUES
left here with my own concern
i do not think i will ever learn
all i know is where to place my urn
right there, on your mantle
i see it now it's in my sight
and i see in it that the time is right
i wear sunglasses just in case i see light
but we all know i won't
go ahead and plead your cases
i can already see your pitiful faces
pretending that i held special places
in each of your hearts
well if you do then you'd better say
a little too late could be anyday
or maybe you'd prefer to do it that way
who knows i never knew you
i spent my life paying for his crimes
and he's the reason i write my rhymes
you've talked to me how many times
and yet sympathy you'll seek
i will leave you with this creed
YOU ARE ALL CONSUMED WITH GREED
here's my heart just watch it bleed
and pretend I never happened
