'INTO TOMORROW'; TRAYVON MARTIN
'Into Tomorrow'
For: Trayvon Martin
By: Bobbie Williams
You don't need to show any sorrow
For I am going into tomorrow
Show you love and keep your faith
For tomorrow may be too late
No one need to cry for me
... in Heaven with God is where I'll be
I don't want to leave any sorrows
They'll go with me into tomorrow
I am not the one who chose to give
up the life that I've lived
I don't want for you to cry
because tomorrow has passed me by
I looked around and I did see
tomorrow reaching out to me
I am young, but I did hear
Tomorrow comming very near
Take my hand, Lord lead me on
For tomorrow to take me home
Hold my hand feel my sorrow
Lead my hand into tomorrow
Someone is waiting for me there
Someone up there who will always care
He'll take my hand he'll take my sorrow
He'll lead us all into tomorrow..............
