WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WORLD
What a beautiful world to find?
Limited space and no competition of any kind
The frog in well thought smilingly
He was enjoying time happily
He though of no other world
He knew nothing about it or was told
With no access or outside contact
He had no reason to feel surprised in fact
One day sea frog luckily entered well
He had different story to tell
“You have not seen vast sea”
I invite you to come and see
The well frog was now really surprised
His life and world was simply confined
He had some lives around and freedom to move
He challenged sea frog to prove
“Your life is limited with no knowledge”
There are countless lives and can not be mentioned on page”
He was in full form to boost all about fact
The well frog was now irritated and decided to act
He was taken at sea shore and shown sea’s vastness
There was surprise element on his face
“Yes, world is too large to understand “
We need more of families as friend
It is applicable to us also
We know really nothing and simply blow
About some of the achievements
In fact there remain much more dedicated efforts
