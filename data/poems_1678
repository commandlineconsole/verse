A MIND CHARGER!
From drowsiness to brightness
My mind changes slowly
In the morning reading newspaper!
Sipping tea step by step I read
Newspaper each and every page,
A pleasure I cannot forego ever!
I skip through and hop over many
Crime and silly news with sports;
But read the analysis in depth for details!
My pleasure of reading boosts with magazines
Accompanying newspapers everyday
Especially Poetry, travelogue and Nature!
My mind battery is charged with news
From newspapers all over the world!
