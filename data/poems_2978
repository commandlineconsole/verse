BURY IT
My lover gave me sorrow
A deep as drifting snow
Shutting out the rays of hope
That defined him in my soul
My lover gave me sorrow
So bitter was the taste
Showing me that holding on
Is such a foolish waste
My lover gave me sorrow
Wrapped in grand design
Teaching me to understand
To leave it all behind
My lover gave me sorrow
For all the love I gave
He taught me just to walk away
And leave it to the graveâ€¦
