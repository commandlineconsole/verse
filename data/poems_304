LOVE IN MY POINT OF VIEW
Love is a mystery leaving no clue
Love is saying I love you
Love is looking at your loved one without saying a word and enjoy it
Love is rare
Love makes us swear
Love makes us care
Love is giving all your heart
Love has its own language that only the ones in love can understand
Love is being more than a friend
Love is hugging the soul
And never letting go
Love is a very special word
If you really mean it
Tell it to the world
Let your soul be heardâ€¦
