MULTIPLY THE PLEASURE
Your presence for me is a great treasure
That always multiplies the pleasure
Because I feel good and strong
And with you I always long
To spend some time of fun
Before life's days are done
For I know whenever I need
You'll come down to remove the weed
The weed that blocks my view
Of joy and pleasure's true
And that's why you're a treasure
That always multiplies my pleasure.
Love You Sunny
