SINCE THE DAY...
My heart is filled with sadness
Since the day you did not call
My hopes and dreams, shattered
It’s tearing me inside
In my house I sit alone
Without you, it’s not my home
A cocktail waiting for you
A special surprise when the night is thru
They will not happen now
Since the day you did not call
Have I made a mistake
Did I believe it was more than it was
My body is craving all you offered
My mind so wanted to ‘cept you
But they are all in limbo now
Since the day you did not call
Please someone, help me understand
Understand where they come from
The flowers planted to start a life anew
Just thinking of nothing but you
I prayed you would show at my door
A surprise for me, having you here with me
The day was born and night came
I lay in bed alone without you
A joyous occasion planned
And now it leaves me wondering
How could I have been so wrong
Since the day you did not call…
