MY PERENNIAL GARDEN
My perennial garden
Is such a delight
Because it keeps blooming
From morning till night.
Delphiniums stand
Back against the wall.
Snapdragons shown there
Are stately and tall.
Blazes of color
Red, yellow, and pink.
Don't forget to give them a drink.
My perennial garden
Is such a delight
Because it keeps blooming
From morning till night...
