MANDY
Knowing how to serve comes from practicing,
With humility and loving-kindness;
But deliver the news to he or she who cares,
And display true love and concern to one another.
Learn my muse and be perfect,
With the concern for the well-being of others;
For i am Mandy in the land of the people of peace!
