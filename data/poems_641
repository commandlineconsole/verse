PASSION'S PLACE
I walk to the edge of the earth
With one step
I am deep in your hearth
Slipping into your arms
Searching for ecstasy
Deep in the wilds
Of your sexual mist
Taking leave of reality
To climax in the heavens
Of orgasmic bliss
As you gently place
Your sweet tender kiss
All over my place
I spread my wings
We begin to fly
Through the moist azure sky
Soaring to passion's place
While losing face
In the heat of desire
As lust takes a walk
On the highwire
Towards the light
While never losing sight
Of passion's goal
Of becoming one
Body, mind and soul
