ANGER
Anger makes you angry
Anger takes out pain
Anger makes you hurt
Anger makes you scream
Anger won't let go
Anger will release and take in fresh
Anger turns people against you
Anger is a feeling that you never felt before and releasing all the bad energy and taking in good energy
You need anger to live
You need anger to move on
