SPRINGSONG
Summer is coming I hear the wind whisper
Tales of new seasons now waltz in the breeze
Daffodils dancing and bluebells are waking
And new leaves are sprigging on every tree
Hark! how the brook sings its song to the fishes
Tripping along in the dawn's golden rays
Leaping and dancing in joy at the dawning of
Summer, 'she's coming, she's coming', she says
May blossom peeping from every new branch, now
New dew like diamonds bedazzle the lawn
Soon, like confetti their blossoms will litter
Our lawns and our gardens as summer is born.
Sing now of swallows a-swooping and soaring
Borne on the mild winds of Africa's Plain
Drawn to their nests built in summers forgotten
To bring forth their babies fly back again
Joy to the ploughboy and joy to the farmer
Joy to the stranger - and you, all my friends
Let's raise a cup to the warm summer sunshine
And welcome the summer as old winter ends.....
