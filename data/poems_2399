OUTLET
Anger is getting worse
Stress taking control
Worries stealing away sleep
There’s no outlet left
I’m falling apart
Music use to work; now it’s senseless words
Only adds to the pain
Cleaning only lasts as long as there’s something dirty
Quickly, I run out of things to clean
Running became too dangerous
And writing isn’t exactly it…
Anger raises until it’s almost too late
Stress is making people harder to stand
Worries, days longer, night sleepless
There’s no outlet left
Slowly, I’m losing sanity, and myself
People want me to talk to them
Don’t understand that
I can’t
That’s not an outlet for me
In one ear, and out he other
I listen but don’t hear
They mean well I know
Still I hear none of any of it
Anger, more anger, gives me headaches
Stress, making me tired, my body aches
Worries take their toll
Don’t know who I wanna be anymore
Or even what I am
Falling apart I am
No longer, do I have an outlet.
