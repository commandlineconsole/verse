LIFE'S GREAT, DON'T YOU KNOW?
Life's great dont you KnOw?
I mean, even in the darkness I still see the brightness in the SnOw
Poverty strucked hard on my FaMiLy
But life's great you know, I have the strength to get thru any traGeDy
Special things in life, are the smallest things in LiFe
Big things, big dreams, money blowing is the devil in disgUiSe
SurpriSe SurpRise, Life's great, have you AriSed?
