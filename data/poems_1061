SONNET: UNEXPECTED THINGS TELL A LOT
A ride that’s free can surely gladden hearts;
A lift that’s early brings in life, great joy;
Recognition by world improves our arts;
Basket of apples free all will enjoy!
Reward that’s big can gladden sure one’s mind;
Long-lasting friendship surely makes one proud;
Promotion early, to work makes one bind;
Great joy is born when people clap aloud.
What ecstasy is found when old friends meet!
Heart knows no bounds when love is back again;
Heart leaps with joy doing the Herculean feat;
What joy fills farmers hearts when comes the rain!
Happy’s the child seeing the lost dog found;
When God forgives our sins, man is dumb-found!
