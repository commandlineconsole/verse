I HAVE FELT SADNESS
i have felt many kinds of sadness
my world has fallen apart time and time again,
i have felt the standard issue sadness
that comes with being a teenager,
that wonderful things called angst.
i have felt that sadness associated with losing both parents
to a terrible accident called divorce,
that's the sadness that rips you in two,
clouds your mind and numbs you to happiness for the longest time.
i have felt the sadness that hits you in waves,
causing you to shudder and draw breath involuntarily.
i have felt that inexplicable sadness that hits you around 2am,
when the silence of night fills you
yet leaves you feeling empty at the same time.
i have felt that numb sadness that strides hand in hand with grief
infecting others like a terrible disease.
i have suffered a broken heart,
a sadness we'll all endure,
the silent scream,
the message in a bottle,
the engulfing sadness that confines you to your pyjamas
and never quite goes away.
i have felt that sadness that gets bottled up
for so long you don't know whether to scream or laugh.
i have felt and endured theses sadnesses,
i have counted my tears,
and i'm still here.
