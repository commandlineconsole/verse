ANGER..
Anger will let you lead to
someday you might regret and
will hurt you...
This is the feeling that you can
learn how to forgive...
you can feel this when somebody
had cause you too much
pain, discomfort and disrespect.
Anger is the root of taking revenge
to those people who made you angry..
However, it is also a way to know
your companions attitudes...
But you still need to realize each
others point to avoid anger to
each other.
Not all the times those who are
angry are those who are right.
Nevertheless, that feeling will
fade once you have forget your
anger and what they have done to you
and learn how to forgive those people
when the time comes.
