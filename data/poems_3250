SOMEONE ELSE
Whereupon your hands brush
Pinpoint fingertips tap
Cautiously over my arm
Sliding off into nothingness
A new presence reveals
An opening from the shade
Longing for someone else
My broken record split
I’ve found a cure for sorrow love
Fall into another someone
Old hearts perish
Paper cream faces melt
I’m liking you so subtly
Picture old obsessions left me dry
His face staggers
Underneath rippled puddles
I’ve found a cure for sorrow love
Fall into another someone
