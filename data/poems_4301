I FEEL FEAR BECAUSE OF YOU
How do i feel without fear.?
Fear of my emotions being used and abused
The fear I feel from not only you but them too
The people of this world think their way is always best
I hope and pray
Both night and day
Although I wait I hear no God
Or maybe I just feel fear for The Answers I might hear
My Fathers hurt me
Doesn't that mean he will too.?
How do I feel without fear.?
Fear of judgement,
Fear of cool
Fear of seeming just like you
You've made me happy
But mostly sad
They say hate is a very strong word and it must be true
But years ago I could've sworn I hated you
