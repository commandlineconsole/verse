THE BEGINNING AND THE END
Both came forward to speak
The truth that they are
Not in a position to
Measure even the visible.
It is for their sustenance
They have appeared here
The beginning and the end
Said before all and they
Clarified they have no control.
It is true I have no concerned
With anything with anybody
It is equally true they have
Concerned with me at this time.
