DON'T LIGHT THE FIRE
I'm trying not to get mad
Mama says anger on fuels ignorance
Don't light the fire she says
But I've never been so tired
Got enough problems
Shouldn't even have to deal with this
Mama says anger only feuls ignorance
Don't light the fire she says
Jumping hurdles
Climbimg mountains
Delegating
Demonstrating
But mama says anger only fuels ignorance
Don't light the fire
Close to the wire
Every minute i tire even more
Keep pushing
Keep pulling
Til I get to the door
Anger only only fuels ignorance
not sure if i can hold it much more.
