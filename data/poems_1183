A POET'S DREAM
To dream of one's being
To feel a certain way
To feel the same pain as the other
To understand everyone else
To express in one's words
To sacrifice one's soul for persecution
To except words of wisdom
To give with pure delight
Only to find pain
To express feelings of the one
To realize it's the same for the whole
To figure and not forget
To realize and not torment
To see, hear and feel
To let this ledger not forget
To except words of wisdom
To give with pure delight
Only to find pain, we as a whole are the same
