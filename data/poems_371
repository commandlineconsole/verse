A MOMENT OF PASSION
A moment of Passion so easily shared,
With no fear or regret,
The momories flood through my mind,
A moment of Passion I'll never forget
A moment of Passion is like a drug,
It takes me so high,
Needing to get another fix,
A moment of Passion can never lie
A moment of Passion when we are alone,
You desire it too,
Unable to control it,
A moment of Passion shared with YOU
