SADNESS
A checkered pattern above this wall
So far from my call
This plane roars above the sky
A sadness clawing at me as I search for the phone
Deep inside hoping you'll be home
A deep trench of loneliness
Longing for your touch of loveliness
A beautiful smile belonging to you
That brightens the very day you pass through
Sadness overcomes me as I hear the ringing
Passing by as the clock is ticking
Hoping you'll come to my call
Though it may be too late for us to fall
