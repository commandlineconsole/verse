O DELIGHT DELIGHT
O delight delight those days
When the sky stars are singing to me
With their colors of bluish grays
To make me become again free
With wings into everything
That grows and grows and never slows
And with my Venus heart shall sing
Until the soil is moonlight glows
O darling fecund soil of frosty earth
Of flowing icily mirror shine
Each step of my step is in their worth
Of every their being breathes line
Where clouds are radiant brows glows
With fertile in their making haze
And I'm as angle in their falling snows
Of white delights on roads of grays
Oh delight be mine in dispels sight
And each azure high heavens on
When night becomes like morning light
And all my wishes will be dawn
In roads of convey sweet tenderness youth
Beneath turnings of cloudy drift
And fill the skies with moments of truth
When you - my soul to those castles lift
