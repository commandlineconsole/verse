I FEAR
I fear for her
that she'll take the labels at face value
and base her life around them.
I fear for him
that he won't realize what he's doing to her
until it's too late.
I fear for them
that the truth of what they have will come crashing down on them
and only one will get back up.
I fear for us
that I'll be wrong, jumping at misconceptions,
it'll be over before it began.
I fear for me
that I'll be right
and I won't be able to catch her when she falls.
I fear for her
that her spirit's been locked by her heart
and her heart has lost the key.
I fear for love
