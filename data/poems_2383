ONE QUESTION ONE ANSWER
What is happiness?
Is it a feeling
And if so does it have purpose
Does it have meaning
If you do not have happiness
this feeling
How does one find it
How do you find an emotion, a feeling
is it at a certain destination,
Do you have a map
Now is happiness classified under emotion
if so is it fleeting
passing through your body like tears from crying
anger, sadness
All of which no one wishes to hold in their possesion
Is happiness a tangible jewel a present
We all wish to be happy in some way
You cant look for happiness you cant question its glory
Life wasnt scripted like a musical play
We know where there are tears and no anger or sadnesss
then those are tears of joy
Happiness
We know when we can breath and exhale the weight in our chest and dispel the anger and sorrow
You can smile and breath let go of the pain
In that is happiness that gives hope for tomorrow
Each day hard with trials that can be overcome
That cannot overtake you dont give them room too
Deal with each of them one by one
Everyone can hold, feel, find or achieve this emotion called happiness
only by knowing that life would not be life
without tears, sorrow, pain, or anger
The point is not to wallow in them but wade
Until eventually the tide descends and your making knew footprints
feeling happier
