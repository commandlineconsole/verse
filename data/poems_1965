OTHER HOUSES
My house builds other houses,
Opening fires and closing the clothes;
Make it exist beyond the shadows,
Surprise us with its expectant earnings.
My mansion manufactures a person of health,
From health to journeys of fires.
The suffering causes more to exceed us,
Like the same puzzle recurring for the better.
My house warns our belongings,
It surprises us once in a while.
After the hill, is a mansion of love,
Hills are like the mountains of our journey.
