' ' ' ' ' A SURPRISE OF BUTTERFLIES(FOR HELEN AND HER GIRL CHILD)
A SURPRISE OF BUTTERFLIES
A cluster
(is that the correct term
for the collective noun)
a cluster
of butterflies?
Maybe it should be
a joy of butterflies
a surprise of butterflies.
My little girl
amazed
as they invade
our garden
even settling upon
her
as if she were
a walking
flower.
She young enough
to believe
these
are the fairies
one reads about.
Imagination
& Reality
for this one
(moment)
becoming
One.

A kindle of kittens...a watch of nightingales...a sulk of foxes! I love the surprising collectives...they are almost surreal.
