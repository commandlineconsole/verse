A SORT OF POEM ABOUT FEAR
Are we all initially driven by FEAR?
Is this negative energy in the form of FEAR necessary in Her grand evolutionary scheme?
Perhaps FEAR is the great catalyst in which LOVE is refined:
FEAR of loss of means is refined to a motivational LOVE to find new, more positive means
FEAR of loss of community is refined to motivational LOVE to build and strengthen community
Fear of God is refined to motivational LOVE to protect and bask in all that IS.
Fear of loss of LOVE is oxymoronic as FEAR is the ABSENCE of LOVE
I am not afraid
