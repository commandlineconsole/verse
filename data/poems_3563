WHAT WE ARE
Though various speculations
concerning our origins have
given birth to many names in many lands

what we are cannot fully be said
we are the spirit of life's great mystery
shared identity of immortality
truth love light and beauty
the darkness the wind and the shadows
we are the sum of all  life's great treasures
attached to the price tag of the human heart
