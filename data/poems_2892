JOY VS SADNESS
I am trying to be joyful in order to not get sad
Sometimes I wonder! Is he really my friend?
If so, please don't let me get sad, do something
In order to see me happy, joyful and smiling
Sadness is pain, sadness is something bitter
I don't want that, I want something better
Joy is relief, joy is something really sweet
And I want that for me, even just a little bit
I guess now you can figure out why I love you so much
I love you because more than anything you give such:
Joyful, happiness, cheer, pleasure, vivacity and much
