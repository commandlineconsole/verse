THE FIRES OF LOVE
The fires of love
can burn out so easily
if they are not tended that well.
They need nurturing and fed
to sustain the passion well.
The fires of love
will smoulder and die
if the coals are not stoked
every once in a while
to sustain passions glow.
The fires of love
are not only for the youth.
Even in age we mellow,
we must still let the embers know
the fire burns within the passions well.
