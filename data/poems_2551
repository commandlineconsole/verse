SADNESS
Sadness feels the air
I can never be happy
He is my happiness
With him gone all i have is sadness
Sadness is everywhere in my life
I love the one I lost
We can never be together
Sadness feels my eyes knowing i cant be with him
The sadness overwhelms me every day
I am filled with sadness of losing my love
