DARLING
Brush my hair aside as
your breath warms my
neck Kiss my body for i
will take you to paradise
over and over again
Darling  you tremble
as i run my nails along
your spine Have kissed
every spot of your body
As you have done mine
Feeling your wants an
desires as your body
rages with passion
But it is i who controls
what burns within you
Taken you to the highest
of pleasure Then stop an
start again Darling when
you have touched the moon
That fire that rages will be
released To be taken to the
highest peak of passion an
desire is to be taken To the
moon an back again
