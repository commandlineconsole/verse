THE SPEECH
Nothing left to say
These floods have taken hold
Filling this earth with rain
Making home seem so cold

So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold

I, I have nothing to say
I, I have nothing to say

And you, you have nothing to lose
You, you have nothing to lose

So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold

Nothing left to say
The floods have taken hold
Filling this earth with rain
Making home seem so cold

Fear
Fear
I am not here
Fear
Fear
I will not fear
