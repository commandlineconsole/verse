UNSEEN DELIGHT
See things in a different light
For there are many unseen delights
Which can surely be full of pleasure
And can make things look like a treasure
And don't only look at the dark side
For world surely is very wide
So drink deep from the cup of life
And enjoy every minute in it that survive
And know if you'll work in your pace
Then surely in this world's race
You'll be able to overcome your pain
That's making you feel down 'n insane
So donot grieve in trouble's pile
For I always like to see you smile
And see things in a different light
For there're many unseen delight.
