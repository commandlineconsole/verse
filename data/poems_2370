AROUSAL IS NOT IN YOUR HAND
Anger and arousal come unasked.
Anger and arousal are unstoppable.
No contraceptives found to stop their births.
The stimuli are the active agents.
Anger and arousal cannot be blocked.
The wise pocket them; the fools spit at spot.
The weak sublimates or broods for a hatch.
