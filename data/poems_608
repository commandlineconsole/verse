MY LOVE
You are my passion
The passion that burns in my heart
I love you
You are my light
The light that lights my way
I love you
You are my path
The path that is my direction
I love you
You are my longing
The longing that is my dream
I love you
You are my thoughts
The thoughts that occupy my day
I love you
You are my world
The world that is my everything
Oh yes, I love you.
