SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
Melvin D. Banggollay
Sleepless night
dwells in my sight
as I can't fight
your charm's delight
dashing like sunlight.
Deep in my solitude
breathing in high altitude,
your sweet memories decode
emptiness that now unfold
deep in my mind's abode.
Even if I tried to sleep
My mind refused to unzip
every memories we sipped
while rolling down the ship.
My eyes kept on rolling high
without even taking a sigh
for the magic of your delight
keep my heart awake all night
till daylight shines so bright.
