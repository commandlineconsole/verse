## A STORY OF HOBO-A/EMULATE 17
The passage of an epoch presented eye opening
revelations before the friend. HOBO-A with his trans-
formation, became a local IDOL. To detriment, it was a
very, very, young audience. HOBO-A was now projecting
influence and mannerisms upon that very young audience.
Girl's and Boy's wearing gold colored jackets. Boy' and Girl's
wearing Roman sandals. A number of each gender, were
observed by the friend with the, LITTLE COOL CHICKEN MAN,
feathers over shadowing the eyes. Noticed in both  play-
grounds and grammar school areas. This to the friend were
the ingredients of a stew, to be cooked.
Such would have it, at a local social gathering. The subject
of HOBO-A came to the surface, by a flock of ravished
and concerned MOTHER'S. Feathers to replace the eyebrows,
empty packets, but most of all, empty and full beer cans
hidden under bedroom beds. The altered behavior was
crux-ed paramount, with the, LITTLE COOL CHICKEN MAN,
strutting walk of their siblings. All for parental concern, to
these young growing families.
Distressed MOTHER'S and homemakers were soon in a
mode, almost like a ceremonial war dance. One mention
was made of forming a gendarme group. HOBO-A, RED
LIGHT ALLEY, and concerned MOTHER'S were headed for
a showdown. Maybe the Lake of Fire, as in the Bible,
would be a place to cool off, at this point.
Concerned, distressed MOTHER'S would surely inflame
HUSBANDS onward. The friend felt helpless now, only a
miracle of GOD'S divine intervention could help HOBO-A.
This now was a time of Great Tribulation. The friend prayed
to GOD for wisdom and understanding. Most of all for
HOBO-A.
