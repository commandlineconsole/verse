LET GO OF SADNESS
Your sadness affects
those around you,
Learn to wipe away
your tears.
Look on the brighter
side of life,
Never Look on the
sad side in life.
Your sadness and grief
only surround me,
Like a sad and grey cloud
always wanting to hang
around.
Learn to pray and believe,
Learn to move forward,
Learn to enjoy life as it
was.
We all must learn to
let go of sadness,
And Leave it all behind.
