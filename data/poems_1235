CHINESE GARDEN
Silhouette of the Chinese Garden pagoda and flora
Against a vast clear grey horizon
Delights an urban city
On a cool Wednesday morn
Birds dialogue about her beauty
Daffodils gaze at her ornaments
Cicadas delight in her brilliance
Creating a symphonic Wednesday morn
O she has a hasty rendezvous
With the caresses of the breeze
Inviting the enchanting colouratura of dawn
Bringing forth a bustling Wednesday morn
