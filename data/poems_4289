FEAR IS NOT A FAULT
Fear is not a fault
There's no need to lay blame
Fear is not a fault
Though it can kill and maim
Fear is not a fault
And can be overcome
Fear is not a fault
Though it's usually not much fun
Fear can tighten around and around
Your mind needs to be gently unwound
All the wrinkles and knots smoothed away
To make for a much more enjoyable day
(Sydney, Australia - 2005)
