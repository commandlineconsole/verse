SADNESS COMES AGAIN AND AGAIN
SADNESS COMES AGAIN AND AGAIN
Sadness comes again and again
As Grief comes again and again
As with aging more friends are lost
Each one is a world gone
And each one's leaving is its own sadness
And there seems no end to this
Until we too will become the source for others' sadness
Sadness comes again and again
So does death
And the very feelings we have today for our lost friend
Others will too one day not too long from now
Have for us.
