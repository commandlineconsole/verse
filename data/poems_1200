CRISSCROSS
In shadow I gaze into the day ahead
A view as age is taking my existence
Where to settle down?
My heart and soul inquiry
To my native land that cultured my youth
America - I took his vigor
to fight the social cancer - being poor
Both gave my life delight
When my strength will fade away
I am confused where to go
Being a Filipino and an American
Both delight are hardly to choose
My heart and soul are in crisscross
as well as with my thoughts to choose
But my heart and soul said this to me
' I love my native land so help me God '
