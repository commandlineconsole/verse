A SONG OF JOY SOUNDS UP
A song of joy sounds up when the day begins
in respect as if every swallow, dove and weaver
worships their creator at the brake of day.
A song of joy sounds up
when the sky is open and blue as ink,
when the bright white sun lights its torch
while the morning star still shines blue-white,
while water rushes and shines in the brook
as if a great morning calls everyone to action
soaking hearts and souls with true love
and a song of joy sounds up...
