MY STATEMENTS OF JOY
I worthily express my statements of joy,
Smart and simple reasoning designs
The joy kept in my night and light,
The very light inside the soul that plays
With fairness and compulsion.
I shall never be forgiven for lusts and strange
Thoughts inside the soul of lives that stand on us.
I shall never be my fair manhood with zeal
For zeal has conquered and gained,
Fetching the light of joy with surprise.
