OH JOY OH JOY (FROM, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NO REASONS)
Oh joy oh joy come here to me
With a morning coming in a song
And set my wings a little free
In rising freedom to cherish among
O love my love let me awake
Where the water is crystal clear
And find the breeze by the lake
With the time of sweetness’s air
Flowers give their blossoms sprung
And bouquets of colors to shade
In living green and seedlings young
Each garden of joy in summers made
Where love is freedom without haste
A living art that gives its pleasure
With every tincture of nature’s paste
In every unfolding we must treasure
Enjoy your freedom in summer's time
Of colors fulsome and youngish look
When growing is giving of its prime
Each day a garden like an open book
Where nothing remains in the same
Of joy to take from to give and bring
Every new morning in its fresh flame
Endlessly to admire and by joy to sing
