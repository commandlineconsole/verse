A CHILD'S DELIGHT
A child's delight-oh, what a sight!
That smile so sweet
And eyes so bright. A child's delight-there is no fright;
That trusting look
Says, "I'm alright." A child's delight-comes in the night;
When tucked in bed
Their dreams alight. A child's delight-it's never trite;
Just open your heart;
What joy you'll invite!
