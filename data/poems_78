I LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU, SAY DO YOU LOVE ME, LOVE ME?
I love you, love you, love you,
I love you, love you,
Say, do you love me?
I love you, love you,
Say, say do you love me, love me?
I love you, love you, say do you love me,
Love me?
O, I love you so much, I love you so much,
Ay, you love me,
How much do you love me?
O, I love you, love you,
Say do you love me!
Ay, you love me, love me,
Are you right?
Ay, you love me, love me
So much so,
But say you, say you, love,
Won’t you forget, forget me,
Say that you won’t leave me?
On the first time say you, say they
So much so passionately,
I love you, love you,
But I know it, know it,
You love me not.
Your false heart, your false love,
I love you, love you
And when the loving is over,
I hate you, hate you
That  I know
To be after new love, new dream,
New girl
With new heart and new proposition,
I love you, love you,
Never, never have I a girl like you.
The same, the same will you say to her again
And thus will win the heart of hers
Betraying me,
Letting to seek consolation in,
As for I love you, I love you already said to.
Showing the dream of false love and false lover,
I love you, love you,
Loving and going,
May I ask you,
Just before go you away, hear it
As for not to say so simply,
I love you, love you,
I love you, love you
Which but I know it, know it,
Who loves whom,
Just to say I love you, love,
That’s not enough
To win the heart of anyone.
Love me, love not my body,
Love my heart, my soul,
If want you to love me,
Love me,
Say you taking the Bible in your hands?
How much do you love me, how much do you love me,
Say you, say you
Taking the Bible into the hands,
You enter into the church and say it before
Holding the hand of mine
That you love, love me,
You love so much,
Never before,
Never again,
Thank you, bye-bye, my love.
