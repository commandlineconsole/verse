TELL ME THAT LOVE RETURNS
Tell me that love returns
to break the silent waves of pain;
those large imperious waves of pain
in the vast ocean of sorrow.
Tell me that love returns
to catch the falling stars;
those bright imperious sparks of stars
withing the vast sky of sorrow.
Tell me that love returns
to mend this broken heart;
this shattered, broken, wounded heart
in the vast soul of sorrow.
