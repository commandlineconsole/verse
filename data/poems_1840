FERRYMAN'S LANE
Looking down ferryman's eyes,
A furnace lit
Growing ember surprise,
Time did not exist,
Though did my demise.
The ferryman spoke,
Much to my surprise,
'Let go of your shadow
and you will surely rise.'
Traced upon space,
The geometry of his eyes,
Along I went,
Much to my surprise.
Shown was I,
All the reasons of why,
Especially,
Why death took my to die.
The ferryman's stone,
Shook my by surprise,
Azure flecked,
With a long golden neck.
A song then kissed the air,
Shattering the illusion,
Of my dispair.
The ferryman reared back,
With one mighty stroke,
Parted the water,
Swept the moat.
Shocked became I,
Seeing from the ferryman's eyes,
A love so divine,
It made me cry.
Rising ever higher,
Not to much surprise.
