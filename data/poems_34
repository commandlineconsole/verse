ALL LOVE IS LOVE
Love the lifted sound of laughter
Love the thought of 'ever after'
Love is love...all love is love
Love the hand that rocks the cradle
Love the working man, so stable
Love is love...all love is love
Love the words, still unspoken
Love the promise, left unbroken
Love is love...all love  is love
Love the minstrel, love the maestro
Love the lyrics, so insightful
Love is love...all love is love
Love the vagabond and vagrant
Love the hand-picked flowers, fragrant
Love is love...all love is love
Love the purity of principle
Love  the idea of thoughts, invincible
Love is love...all love  is love
Love the poor man void of riches
Love the artist, painting pictures
Love is love...all love is love
Love the velvet sky of evening
Love the wandering wounded, grieving
Love is love...all love is love
Love the children chasing rainbows
Love the place we hope their pain goes
Love is love...all love  is love
Love the two who stand United
Love their vows, in truth, recited
Love is love...all love is love
Love the pleasure and the purpose
Love the lasting three-ringed circus
Love is love...all love is love
Love the memories made each minute
Love the life you're living...in it...
Love is love...all love is love
Love the sister and her brother
Love in peace...Love one another
Love is love...all love is love
LOVE IS LOVE...ALL LOVE IS LOVE!
