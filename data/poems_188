MY WALL CLOCK
Love, love and Love
You are my love
I love your eyes
They are oceans of love
I love your smile
They are symbol of love
I love your cheeks
They are the fruit of love
I love your figure
The valley of love
I love your silky hairs
They are the chains of love
I love you
As you are an idol of love
Shashikant Nishant Sharma â€˜Sahil'
