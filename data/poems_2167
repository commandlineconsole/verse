MEET ME?
A pleasant echo from the past
strayed through the valleys and the hills,
I live here, in a world so vast
and full of cheaters and small shills.
The sound sat on my collarbone
and raised its wonderful blue eyes
up to my inbuilt microphone,
to whisper 'Sweetie, a surprise'.
I knew not what to say in turn,
instead I puckered up my lips,
She kissed me back, my razorburn,
I dreamed of tall and sailing ships.
And, in the end, I let her hug
the lot of me, like in the past.
Now, near the fire, on the rug
I prayed to God to make it last.
He did, are you surprised my friend?
Time was suspended and we stayed
a bundle of strange joys to mend
old memories, alive and frayed.
She called me Sweetie, I am hers
her hand in mine, hike the Cascades.
So will you, sweetie, take these furs
and meet me in the Everglades?
