LOVING AGAIN
Last night
we loved as if
the sky would fall
while we slept.
We loved
passionately
selflessly
thinking only of pleasure
giving pleasure,
Daybreak.
The sun slid silently
into
our room
kissed our faces
and lay softly
in our bed of love.
The sky had not fallen.
The earth had not disappeared.
We were alive to love again
