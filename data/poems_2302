PHOBIA OF ME
bouncing around inside my head
trying to escape this feeling
the feeling of anger and fear
so intense my mind is reeling
break free soon or end up brain dead
voices say what no one else hears
anger at myself for not knowing
anger at the world for not caring
i used to be happy and care free
now i can feel the anger growing
taking control, its over bearing
stress builds up as i try to leave me
fear of losing you overwhelms
i cant take the intensity
it hurts to think, let alone straight
i cant stop, my own private hell
worrying over you and me
fear destroys as i sit and wait
anger and fear eats away at me
making it hard to breathe
and concentrate on livng normally
as i try to hide my phobia of me
