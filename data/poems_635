EYES AND EARS
Eyes and ears have blessings, too much for the heart,
And the passion that uncovered them was not the part.
Glancing with passion is thrilling like seeing,
An object I refer to the public-being.
As she nears, the eyes are calm in the face,
As the nose smells, the tranquillity has a place.
Eyes are seeing wonderfully well,
As too many visions work in a cell.
