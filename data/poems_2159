LIFE STORY
If I could only make sense of it all.
My life.
My life doesn't make sense.
Well, at least to me.
I'm confused.
I don't know how to describe.
My feelings.
I don't know myself or anyone else.
I thought I did,
I guess I don't.
I try to write it down,
but my pen stops.
Where I start.
Am I suppose to tell my life story?
Or am I suppose to ease to create constant shock and surprise?
I don't want to surprise or shock anybody.
I guess I'm looking for answers.
Haven't gotten any yet.
Thank you.
