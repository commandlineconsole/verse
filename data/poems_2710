A WHISPERY HOLLOW TRANSFIXED AWE
A Vow In Making
A Venture Forth Back
A Fallen Innocent
Gave Rise To Fallen Hearts

Arise The Sadness
An Isolatory Night Glimmer
Upon A Night Full Of 'A.I.'
Filled The Night Sky

As Everything Grew Dark
But Alight Of A Face
A Whispery Hollow Of Me
In Being Driven The Opposite Way She Was Forward

A Moment's Glimpse Transfixed
Upon A Night Drive Back
Transfixes My Sadness
Of A Vow Affixed In Promise

A Vow One Night To Return
In Seeing Her Upon Happenstance
A Madness Grew From A Silent Vow
To Fill Her Hollow Empty Of A Boy

In Hesitation To Fulfill A Vow In Having Made
Increase OF Guilt For An Unfulfilled Love
In Fathering A Future Child Made Ephemeral
Forgotten Night Glimmer Ten Years On

Remembered Now In Looking Forward
Transfixed Sadness Of A Whisper Upon A Night
Vow Of Grandeur Defined With Sadness
Of A Vow Of Marriage Within A Dream
