THIS LIFES JOURNEY
The Spirit gives Courage
to fainting hearts.
A seed is planted,
Watered by prayer,
Courage grows-
Reaching ever toward the light.
Standing in God's love
Risks can be taken-
Without fear of failure,
And without fear of success.
Courage is
Walking this lifes journey
Peacefully.
With no fear of others
Or fear of yourself
