A BLISS FOREVER!
Lovers entwined as creepers explore each other!
The world is in turmoil and terrorists explode daily;
But lovers forget all in exploration of love within
Like one browsing computer to explore inner space,
Like the astronauts explore Outer Space for life!
Between violence and sex there is no difference
As there is noting fair and foul in war and love!
Terrorists have no boundaries and concern for all!
Lovers too have no limit and concern for anything!
Of the two which is better?  That is the question!
Terrorists do anything aiming paradise after death,
A nonsensical notion they are brainwashed long!
But lovers do anything aiming bliss only as goal
Which they achieve forever as love is immortal!
