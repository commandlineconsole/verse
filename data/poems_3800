MYLOVE WILL SHOW YOU EVERYTHING...
I don't know who you are,
And from where you come from,
I don't care what you do,
And I don't want how do you look,
I don't care about your religion,
And I don't care about your status,
I don't care maybe you are a queen out there,
And I don't care maybe you are a poor girl out there,
I don't care the distance between us,
And I don't care the countries which divide us,
The Only Thing I Care is YOU, Only YOU.
Just think of me for a while,
Leaving everything behind.
You can feel My TRUE LOVE on you.
Just think of MY LOVE for a while,
And MY LOVE WILL SHOW YOU EVERYTHING.
I LOVE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE...
Dedicated for My Love...
Please don't copy... thank u...
