JOY
Joy is contentment of the mind
Which in the heart you will find
When your heart is never blind
To painful deeds and words unkind
A joyful heart always tries to impart
Some sacred scenes right from the heart
With cheerful notions from the start
And cheers you up without throwing dart
The joy you will find in the human heart
Is not confined to those who are smart
Or who think they drive a better car
But to those who are the set apart
Joy is a state of the heart and mind
When with God they intertwine
Connect with love that is divine
Producing ecstasy so sublime
To have this joy you must decline
From sin and darkness in your life
Reach out to others and you will find
That joy is truly a state of the mind
