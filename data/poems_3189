SORROW AND GUILT
Sorrow is evil,
Sorrow is blind,
I once was happy,
Now I have no mind,
Depressed and lonely,
Here I lay,
I feel the guilt,
Till the end of day,
Every night,
Is an endless jail,
I lay down thinking,
I deserve to be nailed,
Because of sorrow,
I want to die,
I think about it,
Till morning nigh,
Friends have been torn away,
All my  love,
Has been stolen from me,
From a once peaceful dove,
It may have had its reasons,
But my heart now has a hole,
I can't seem to find the piece,
So now I have my goal,
A goal that seems absurd,
But to me it's all I've got,
I try not to think about it,
But I think quite allot,
My goal is to live,
Live until I die,
And not kill myself,
Because then my family would lie,
They'd lie and say I loved life,
It's not true AT ALL,
To me life sucks,
I just want to fall!
