SLEEP WELL
Sleep well my dear
And may you find the morning bright
And may your dreams of fond delight
Entrance you while you slumber.
Sleep well my dear
And may angels dance in fairytales
And ships float by with magic sails
To delight you while you slumber.
Sleep well my dear
And may your cares float clear away
And may you hear me softly say
I love you while you slumber.
