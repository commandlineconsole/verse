A MOTHER'S CARE
A mother's care is the best of all
For she never lets you fall
For with her love, care and smile
You can easily go a long mile
For a mother is really great
So always put on her your faith
And know that her love and care
Is a precious gift so rare
So love her and know it is true
that when you're feeling blue
Then deep inside her heart calm
You can find your pain's balm
So love her and pray to God
That for you in even and odd
Keep the shadow of her care
Because her presence is a gift rare.
