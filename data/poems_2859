LEFT ALONE
Why is it that I'm so close to the fire but
I don't feel anything at all?
Why is it that from that day,
all I feel is sadness?
The person that has been beside me all my life
Is now gone
Now I'm all alone
This feeling of sadness I never knew
I was always with that person
Did everything with them....
But now they're gone...
The word 'sorry'was
said and meant in that letter
But I just couldnt forgive it
I was only crying
The first and last,
Good bye
