MISERY
concerned with matters
which are not at all concerned
trying for needless changes_
rejecting natural ones,
aspiring for unnatural ones
Loving and thriving for undeserved
things hating deserved
climbing the ladder placed
on slippery or on loose ground
to cross the castle of air
to reach to dream palace
The strain futile, pain and agony
remains reality for the one who
slipped into real pond, trying to avoid
illusory pond as did Duryodhana
In palace of Yudhistira in Indraprasta.
