FOOLED BY LOVE
Love is pain; i loved love but love didn't love  me
love told me what i wanted to hear but never
what i needed to hear
ever since i told love i love him and more
love found more ways to get me out the
door
love must have blind me because i didn't
see it coming, i wanted love to treat me better but
that wasn't love's kind of loving
love continued to hurt me until there was
no-more of me
I lefted love with a lesson learned find
a true love or get fooled by love
