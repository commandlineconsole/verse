I HATE THESE POEPLE.
Its nobody eles buisness
why is it everyones concern
why do you need to know
'do you work' they always ask
i say no and they look upon you with arrogance
they immidiately think they're above you
they question your life from that moment
'why' they ask
but you cant explain it
they have an expectation for you
they need to know everything about you
they want to open you up
its not their concern
why do these poeple need to know
why do poeple need to know what everybody else is up to
they have it in their head that you need to be doing something
and i dont know why that is
human nature
no, it cant be
i hate these poeple
they want to feel they're above everyone
they need to feel like some of the society is under them
and if your not doing something that they are
or doing something that they are not
they look down on you
its their way of feeling better
they need to find out everything about you
question everything about you and your life
and why your not doing something
i dont need these poeple
these poeple need to be destroyed
i hate these poeple.
