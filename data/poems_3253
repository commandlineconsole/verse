THE BLESSED
Blessed are they that mourn
Is what our Lord Jesus said
And He promised we'd be comforted
As we sorrow for our dead
Time may seem like eternity
While we suffer in our grief
But our sorrow will be shortened
If in God we have belief
But first God will allow us
To experience the grief and pain
Of not being with the one we loved
Till He joins us once again
But God our Holy Father
There, to ease his children's pain
Says, we only need to come to HIm
In prayer, then peace we'll feel again
This does not mean, we'll forget
Our loved one who has gone
It means the sadness in our hearts
Won't be there for so long
