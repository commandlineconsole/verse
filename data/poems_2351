EMOTIONS
Hate for many things
Anger everyday
Like an emotional bomb
Soon to go off, for unknown reasons
Yet another problem
To make it tick faster
To make it closer to exploding
I feel too much pain
Or none at all
But everything in my life
Pulled together
Boil inside me, disrupting my emotions
Leaving another layer of anger/pain
That never dissolve away
Such anger, like mine
Seems hidden, behind a smiling face
And glassy eyes
It is tamed for the moment
But when the time has come
Of too much mixed together,
When it becomes unbearable
I won't hold back
I will refuse to stop
I will let everything out
Of my heart, body, and soul
With such a violent manner
With no regrets
Ever
