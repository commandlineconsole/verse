I FEAR
I fear to dream
As you came into it
I fear to open my eyes
As you stay my forward
I fear to speak
As you stolen my words
I fear to fly
As you broke my feathers
I fear to live as you
Stolen my heart
I fear to listen the  heart beat
As it reminds our past
Now
I fear to trust this world
As you broke my faith
