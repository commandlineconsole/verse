WHY SHOULD 'I' BLOG
why should i publish my daily log
will it matter to  others whether i eat a hen or a hog
why should i share my innermost thoughts with people who hardly care
why should i recount my endless struggle for a decent day and place it here
why should i detail my joyeous moments and lay my heart bare
why, why in midst of all who will never care should i share
a realization struck why there is so much of 'I' in me
what about those very few who used to have a part in me
for those few who cares for me and about whom i care
i shall keep baring my heart and thus i share
