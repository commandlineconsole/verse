READ THE BIBLE
Take God at His word, read the bible every day
It will lift your head, upon your way
You are his ever living, loving concern
Old things will pass, His love he will affirm.

Read the bible, it is holy, it is right
Turn from the wrong, turn form the night
Believe in His great love and grace
He will be with you day by day, face to face

Hold fast to Gods Word, his mighty command
Read the bible, hold it in your hand
turn the pages, remember him today
His love is forever, and forever, turn not away.
