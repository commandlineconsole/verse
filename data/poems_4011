WHAT IS THE STATE
What is the state at the waking in the next morning
What is the state I sit in the snowhouse like a grandfather
it's all about an unprepared moment
I'm tired, sitting down on a stone
who cares is it famous for Tess sit down there centuries ago
who cares is it a spot site good for graphing
who cares is it a natural magnifisence
who cares where it is!
who cares after years I see it as a failure
who cares back home I enjoy myself by its coincidence
I told myself many times who I am
that's why I never was frown that I could never get the colors back again
Time is for letting it go
I am still here after all these
