ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
sorrow comes with love
one way or another
sorrow will always be there
bind with love that i have
it's a package
bliss & grief are tied up together
united
it will not go anywhere
giving so much pain
but i'm fine
i'm trying to be just fine
this way i choose
leaving trace of pain
in its every step
sorrow comes with love
one way or another
but not to you
you don't deserve that
you'll find your heaven
you'll find your angel
you'll be fine
i promise you'll be just fine
