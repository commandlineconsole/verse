HEALING HEART
Shattered, forced to heal as greatness unveils thine soul. Hope whipered in the distance, to recover thine lost love. Tis night brings tender passing, healing thine soul with glorious blunder. cause not one or two, but dissapated nights of dreams. Sadness comes to end; happiness conquered hate. Love sprouting-sadness shrinking, hope has come again.
