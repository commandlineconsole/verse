PASSION'S PYRE
Shivers transcend over my body when PASSION whispers in my ear,
Then PASSION gently caresses my skin and electricity fills the air!
Insatiable PASSION takes control and lights the flame of desire,
I am but kindling set at the base of PASSION'S growing pyre.
When PASSIONS' pyre roars to life it's FIRE I become,
Wild with desire in PASSIONS' PYRE I burn until I am done...
