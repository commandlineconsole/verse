LIFE
Life has much to teach us in everyground,
Whether it is barren or crowded around.
There is danger at every step of our Life,
We are joyous at one moment and sad at another moment,
This is what we mean to Life.
Life is too hard to tolerate,
It seems to be a magnet.
Magnet to sorrows, sorrows and only sorrows,
We should accept the truth of life sorrows.
We are given birth in this world to see both the sides of Life,
One side being the Heaven and the other side as Hell as cuts were to Ceaser through knife.

Life has  lot to teach us,
It is b'ful from inside but a burning coal from outside,
We are lucky enough to see these both the sides,
And should be provoked for all flights.
