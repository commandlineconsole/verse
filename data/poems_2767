SADNESS
Lost then found then lost for eternity;
Sadness, this is the story
Found
She found me against the assembled odds,
Lonely, my life blood flowin'
Like water on earth spreadin'
From beyond, I heard her voice,
A lost man is saved,
Her arrows have pierced
Lost
I had seen love lost on earth;
Like the beast hidden in hell
Its countenance bold;
At its discretion governin' the thunder
Tramplin' on its enemies defeated:
I had that happen, and happen again
Found
Then she came, and her love was good
Happiness in me who knew the sweetness
I felt young, in the shadow of her beauty;
The most charmin' dreams have nothin'
Comparable, comparable
The torrents of pleasure
She spread in my heart
Lost
Then she was gone and her love no more
Sadness in me who knows the bitterness
Sadness
Nothin' soothes, nothin' forgives;
Crazy heart abandoned
It awaits the return;
It excuses my weakness;
To get me down it hastens:
For the words she uncovered
Are all I know of affection
If I could share my love with her
Sadness
It shows there is no mercy
One of the not chosen
It has revealed its pain
Sadness
Could I share my love with her
Sadness
That it not be blessed, that it not be sung;
Though it will be known to me
Beyond time and age,
Beyond the eternity
