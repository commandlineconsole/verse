SILENCE NO MORE
Silence means you never hate me
silence means you will again date me
silence means you need some time
silence means you are fine
silence meanse the hopes are alive
tears came out of my eyes
silence is no more surprise
silence is only you know
silence is what you show
silence is to only glow
silence means only to give
silence means you will forgive
tears pours out of my eyes
silence is no more surprise...
