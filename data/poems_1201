A SMILE IS NOT ENOUGH
a smile is not enough
to show, just how I feel,
express my inner thrill
of delight,
it must be more
to show that I adore
or have this fright
and desire to touch,
laughter is induced,
by some strange mixture
of thoughts and feelings,
once it is out
it is the most contagious of delights.
infects those near and far,
to reproduce
emits such  lovely sound and more
music, pleasant to the ear,
a smile is definitely not enough
once you know of laughter
