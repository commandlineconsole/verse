CARE 4 YOU WHY
Why do I care 4 you
Why am I there 4 you
Why do I Try
I am lost in my fellings
I am lost in careing 4 you
Nobody cares about me
All alone
All by myself
Lost inside
Lost on the outside
No fellings
No where to go
Care 4 You Why
Why do you not care 4 me
Lost forever
No point to care
I don't need you
Care 4 me please
I am alone in this empty world
Filled with no care and love
I shell end it all no more careing 4 you my endless hope
