23FEB WAIT FOR LAST MIRACLES LAST POCKETS OF HOPE
day’s heat hot dust sweat
day’s heat hot fear sweat
day’s heat fear darkness trapped
night fear earth blanket sweat
night fear earth darkness sweat
night fear chill fear buried alive
with reverence we dust dig
with reverence we hope dig
decay steals into noses silence says
dig in ruins of other buildings
dig in ruins where hope lays trapped
dig where dogs nose hope life trapped
these dead here will wait for last rites
these dead will wait to be reverence buried
wait for last miracles last pockets of hope found
