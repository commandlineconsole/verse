PASSION
He grabs her with a force caressing her back
Kneeling back she spins
Red dress sweeping the floor
She is pulled in with great might
Two bodies soon became one
Eyes in a deep trance
Breathless with passion
Spun out and pulled back
Never letting go
Hands intertwine
Arising heat
Sparks flying
Moving as one
Feeling each other
A war for passion is on
With no hesitations they fire
Both strike their target
She is held tight
The moment is taken in
Closed eyes
Hearts beating
Grasping for air
Hair a mess
Clothes ripped
The song ends yet the passion remains
