NO ONE CARES
no one cares about
the girl with black hair
no one cares about
that girl who lives up stairs
no one cares about
the girl who is on the street
no one cares about
the girl who hurt her feet
no cares about
the girl who feels dead inside
just for get
I think I just want to go to bed
GOOD BYE
