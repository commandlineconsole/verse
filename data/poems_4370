FEAR
From the ocean of feelings,
There comes a term “fear”.
It feels to you, whenever
You face loneliness which you can't bear.
Papa says, ‘Fear is in your mind,
It isn't real.’
But when I listen to my grandmother's stories
There comes a term “fear”.
Science says, ‘Ghosts are nothing,
So that will not bring your tear,
But now it's confusing,
Then why they created this word, which he hear?
Fear is here, fear is there,
Fear is everywhere.
It just needs lackness
Of the power to bear.
I’m not scaring you, nor helping you
But for me, it always happens
That, from the ocean of feelings
There comes a term “Fear”.
