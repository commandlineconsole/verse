TWO WAYS OF LIFE
I don't know how to take this life
Take is very serious or as a joke
Make it just a fun or a strife
Both ways, life is not all the same
It changes sadness to joy
And solitude to fame
A frolicking young lad
Or a pondering old guy
Sitting at park-side
Or jumping into joy
The lad will be an old guy
And joy turns to gloom
Youth says you 'good bye'
And Happiness makes its room
Ah! Trouble me no more
I will rather sit alone
Or jump the party on the shore
And let my worries be bygone
