0410 THE RUNNER
you're still running
in the dark between the
dangerous lights.
you don't hear their footsteps
any more. they may have
given up. but chasing you
with noiseless footsteps, is still
fear. when to stop running?
one day, perhaps, no longer
the faint chill sound of fear
chasing silently.
just, quieter still,
the fear of fear.
