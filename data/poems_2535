A LOVE POEM
Feelings from your heart will wave some day.
My picture will be placed in it an awesome lay
Your outlook will change
I would have come in your range.
Whether say yes or no,
Be with me and let me know.
Magical your destiny is and I am the way.
Something paranormal will happen
I absolutely would get your heart access coupon.
I know you have a cold blooded heart
My feelings will get supremacy on that
Slowly I will become your desire
Winning me would turn into your aspire
Emotion and Love is my only weapon.
Share it with me; you have no cost to pay.
Day will come your anger become slow
With no time the monsoon of adore will blow
Butterfly will distribute the color
My trying will become the achievement pillar
Fume of angriness will be dissolved
Entire distance between you and me will be solved
We both will sail in the love stream flow
Sun will hide beyond the cloud with mild ray.
Feelings from your heart will wave some day.
My picture will be placed in it an awesome lay
