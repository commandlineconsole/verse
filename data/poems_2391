MY ANGER
Anger is a feeling,
something that can control you
if you let it.
some people take their anger out
on other people, or other things.
i tend to do it differently.
some people write when they are angry
some people draw.
me, im not like any of these people at all.
i dont let my anger show to anyone but me.
i keep my anger to myself
but when it gets to be too much
i just cant control myself
i go to my room and lock the door,
blast my music untill every voice in my head
telling me not to do what im about to do
is just a blurr
i open my drawer,
take out my sissors, and i cut
untill the pain in my arm dulls out
the pain in my heart.....
then im done.
put the sissors away,
turn off the music,
unlock the door,
and go on with my life.......
untill i just cant take it any more.
