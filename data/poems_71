DO LOVE
Love, connection with a thing. An inner love, an outer love, an inner love, an outer love. Love given, love as source, love the connection, love the life force. No greater love, then my love, which loves all that can be loved. Love with wisdom, love with shared intent, love is what is, and with love I am sent. An inner love, an outer love, an inner love, an  outer love. This love is meant to love, what is to love, and love content. Love inside, love outside, love to break away, love to divide, love to unite, love to build strength, love to have life, love to stand upon when the ground shakes. Love, connection, love deep or far out and lost, love inside remembered for a forever, love no cost.
