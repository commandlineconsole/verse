COHABITATION
I once invited a clean favorite
Lady of mine
To pleasure the pleasures we aught
To have when we are union
As one partner should be
“She was the one to be tendered”
Because a man was pleading for Marriage
I changed my way of living
Because now I have to be
One women man
But she wasn’t the one
Because six moths later
When we were experiencing impediments
She showed her true colors
“Its good you know, I saw this earlier”
Because she wasn’t worth my cows
She didn’t deserve my children
I thought of that
While I was sitting on top of the rock
Pointing with my finger the place
That used to be mine
But not anymore
