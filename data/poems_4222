LAST DAY
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
He looks and wanders
Face all covered with scars.
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
He whispers chills into the air
He freezes my soul with a single stare.
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
Blood red shot eyes look at me
The fear in my brown one's he can see.
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
Step by step he limps his way
Thump by thump my heart fears today was its last day
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
I turn around and start to run from that stare
But when I turn he stands right there.
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
He smiles exposing rotting yellow teeth and horrible breath
I know that this is a sign of Deah.
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
I close my eyes and pray
'Oh God, I wish I'd lived today as if it were my Last Day.'
