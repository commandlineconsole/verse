LIFE
Life
Life has it's ups and downs
It's like a rollercoaster ride
As you go up your adrenaline goes with it
When you go down you let it all out.
Life is full of surprises,
And can be good when you live it to the fullest
There can be fortune and fame in the future
Then again,
Life can be a waste of time when you feel the world has turned against you.
Life can be cruel and can leave you in misery and despair.
Some experiences can be both good and bad
But you learn and live with your experiences.
Life also comes and goes,
When it comes it is considered a precious joy and can fill your life with happiness,
It's a time for celebration of any kind
But when it goes, it is a time for mourning,
Sadness and pain,
But when you finally learn to cope with the pain you can live your life
It can be hard at first
You miss the person, but there is nothing you can do
There is really nothing you can do or say to them
You can just pray and hope they have moved on to a better place
Life is like a rollercoaster ride
And full of surprises
It can be good
Or it can be bad
