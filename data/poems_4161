FEAR
What is fear?
What is the feeling?
What is your thoughts?
Can fear be good,
Can fear be stopped?
There is not a person who can explain this
even if you are all grown or not.
The fear of love
The fear of people
but most of all the fear of Death.
This will be a lot less of a mess
If you had God's bless.
Fear is that weird feeling
where you wish you could be faking
and then curiosity overcomes fear
wich will lead you in deep
and that my friend will leave you with a real scare
The fear that makes your adrenalin run
like a bullet through a gun
Thats the fear, I am talking about here.
