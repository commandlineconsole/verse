SADNESS CALLS ANXIETY ALSO
SADNESS CALLS ANXIETY ALSO
Sadness calls Anxiety also
The day has not yet really begun
And already I am lost in it-
What to do? What to work on?
Perhaps to try to escape and do nothing
A sure recipe for greater anxiety and sadness
â€˜Screw your courage to the sticking place'
I'll try-
These lines as a small beginning
To help me take strength and hope-
After all the years and with all the experience
Still
I am as if I do not know where I am
And how to begin this day.
