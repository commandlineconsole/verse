STAY FOR A WHILE
Stay for a while
In this life's trial
And then surely
You'll meet smile
And don't mope
Neither lose hope
And then surely
You'll get joy's rope
For life is bend
And full of dents
But there you'll meet
With joy in the end
Only if you learn
How to turn
On the happiness code
So joy can return.
