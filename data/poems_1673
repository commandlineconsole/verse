! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WOMB! [POEMS ENDING WITH AA-2]
Whales of enticements beached
On the moistened hem of your lingerie
Tongue struggled to lick and lap it back
Indulging squirming in the salt
In this slit, silted with all pleasure
I discovered, I lost; was a king was a pawn
Kindness begot kindness and I could sense
Some salvation efforts elsewhere too
Gagging, throttling, sidestepped
Earnestness to yield stepped up
Now desire bestraddle desiring
And that slurping symphony begins
Gulping, guzzling engulfed
Pleasure on an exponential tangent
Seeking replication of every cell
On the smirch less canvas of womb
