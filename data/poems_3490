FRUSTRATION
You're losing yourself a litle more every day
And you're losing me and I'm losing you a little more in every way
Your fear and confusion multiply every day
And you are lacking a way out in every way
To my loving concern your ears are deaf
To my loving concern your eyes are blind
I wish I had a magic wand
To heal your pain of every possible kind
But my lacking that tool
It remains a miss
All I can do is send you a kiss
This is more for you
Than it is for me
But once again
I fear you will not be able to see
So painful as it is for me
All I can do is pray that God Bless Thee!
