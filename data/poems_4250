I FEAR...
I fear to hear that voice that takes me to the clouds
farther, from where i might not return
i fear to stare into those eyes
lest i fall into them, to be held spellbound for all eternity
i fear to kiss those lips
lest i be turned into a statue, to be frozen for a thousand years
i fear to be with you
but i fear more to be without you
so let me play cautious and watch; lest i fall in love...
but its too late for without a remedy
i've already fallen
