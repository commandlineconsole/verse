WHY?
you said that everything about me mattered to you
my question is why?
im use to everyone not caring and saying bye
but your diffrent
theres something about you that reassures me
they all say the same things
but yet with you im so certain that your telling the truth
i ask you why you care?
you say i cant bear.......
to be without you
or hear or see anything happen to you
you say that you care about a few things in you life
and im one of them
why?
why do you sound so happy when you say hi
why? are you so sweet
why?
im not use to being cared about like you care about me
i think about you all day
and night
and i still wonder why do you care about?
