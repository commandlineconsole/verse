WHO AM I
Who am I?
When the future matters but a little
And willingly, it is sacrificed now
To meet, the pressing demand of today
when destiny carries no value
And appetite, I highly esteemed...
To eat, drink, and merry all the day
When the pleasure of iniquity
Ridiculously makes meaning..
Than the treasure of tomorrow
When I deny, only what hinders...
The excitement of the now
To maintain, sustain, and retain
My current enjoyment
When I exaggerate my need
And deliberately underrate yours
To manipulate the moment
When the realm of the moment
Is all I see
And picture outside this realm
looks blur to me
When I have a choice..
Purpose and pleasure
And pleasure overwhelmed my choice
While, purpose is sacrificed on the altar of pleasure..
I go anywhere
And come anytime
I sleep anytime
And wake anytime
I speak any how
And mind not who got hurt
Who am I?
