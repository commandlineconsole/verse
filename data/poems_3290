TO WHO IT CONCERNS
to who it concerns
My homework will be late
It fell onto my pancakes
and stuck to my plate
To who it Concerns
My mom made me write this
and I'm just a kid
so how can i fight this
To who it concerns
I lost my assignment
maybe I'll get lucky
solitary confinement
To who it concerns
I just turned 15
too short to be shortstop
too plain to be queen
to who it concerns
I'm great with a ball
but boys don't watch tomboys
as they're cruising the hall
to who it concerns
I'm not made of steel
when I get blind sighted
my pain is quite real
i don't mean to squawk
but it really burns
so I thought i'd just mention it
to who it concerns
