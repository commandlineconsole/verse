PEOPLE
People.
i fear People
and their potential impact on me
i fear change
i fear intimacy
i fear getting close to people
i fear losing people
i fear getting hurt.
i fear falling and not having the will and energy to stand up again, to just splat until.. until what..
i fear the process
not the end.
