I DONT CARE
I try to make it through my life in my way
there is you
I try to make it through these lies
and thats all I do
just dont deny it
just dont deny it
and deny it
yeah deal with it
you tried to break me
you wanna break me
bit by bit
that's just part of you
if you where still alive
I dont care
I dont care
and all the things you left behind
I dont care
I dont care
I try to make you see my side
always trying to stay in line
but your all I see; rights through
thats all you want to do
Im getting tired of this SH#T
I got no room when this is it
but if you want me just deall with it
so.....I dont care
I dont care
and all the things you left behind
I dont care
I dont care
