A CUP.....
I drink from a cup filled with sorrow,
Bitter and sweet yet it has a symphony of no tomorrow.
And all around me I’m surrounded by these familiar and unknown roses,
All with an expressionless composure.
As I feel like any delusional man should,
Invisible and misunderstood.
Yet It’s funny and sad how sorrow and depression,
Becomes my sweetest companions.
Tell me death, tell me love
How these inspiring dreams do fasten an abandoned dove,
Into the cup from, which I drink my own sorrow.
