WITHOUT LOVE
Love is forever
but without love we wouldnt be together
Love is right
but without love no one can fight
Love is wrong
but without love no one is strong
Love is faithful
but without love we are shameful
Love is true
but without love what would the world do
Love is thankful
but without love life is painful
Love is awesome
but without love everyone is lonesome
Love is powerful
but without love people are hateful
Love is countless
but without love LIFE IS USELESS.
