LONELY MAN
You seek comfort
From the women you pay
Yet they care not of your sorrows
They care of nothing but the paper in your pocket
You seek comfort
From your collegues
Yet they care not of the surrounding darkness
They care of nothing but the sweat you give
You seek comfort
From relatives both young and old
Yet they care not of your toubles
They care of nothing but themselves
You seek comfort in them
You have yet seeked my comfort
Why is that?
I am closer to you than your brother
I am farther than your sister
I am more caring than the whore
I am less caring than the lover
I am eternal
I am forever
Seek your comfort in me
I know what is right
I know what is wrong
I can help you surpass the pain
I can show you love from hate
I will guide you to the lasting faith
Until the light dies from your soul
You are the lonely man
Seek your comfort in me
