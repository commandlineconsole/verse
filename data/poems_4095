FEAR
Its fear that whispers to me in my ear, it is fear that I hear say
“You’re afraid of me the most; I’ll hold you back all day”
Its fear which I listen to, to make my every decision
Its fear that helps to guide me on, creating each vision
Fear produced the stutter; I struggle with in every speech
Fear is the ten foot pole, pushing it just out of my reach
Fear is my only barrier, keeping me from what I desire
The death of fear is what I need to increase my inner fire
