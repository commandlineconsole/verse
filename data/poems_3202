AS WE BASK IN SORROW
While recently having a conversation with a friend, we discussed 'basking in sorrow, ' which by definition, is an oxymoron.. bask meaning to take great pleasure or satisfaction; and sorrow meaning loss or despair.
Therefor; we bask in sorrow.
Here we sit and bask in sorrow
Secretly begging for the morrow
A smile upon the outside face
Strength that shows as we run our race
Happiness is never too far away
Genuine cheer throughout the day
But a certain sadness wears us down
And being alone makes us frown
For this is what causes our heartache and grief
It hides under smiles, the sly little thief
So though we are basking in our sorrow today
We might soon find something to keep it at bay
