SEARCH FOR THE DIVINE
Words are few to describe the gentle crackling of an early dawn
When dark turns to life in a crisp new bristling
When enthused winged creatures stir away the nightly yawn
With sounds of verve on green growth moist’ning
Oh the marvel of passion that fills
When the root of beauty pierce senses and the heart stills
When in the midst of those who speak with crudeness
With tongues dragging forlorn in the slums of mind
From mouths that leak into bits of lewdness
I yearn to places apart from the residue of such kind
To the marvel of passion that fills
When the root of beauty pierce senses and the heart stills
I stand at a coast on the rocks in the night
Gazing out over waters with waves at wild
On the skyline flashes of lightning with might
Light the dark brooding clouds and rain falling mild
Oh this marvel of passion that fills
When the root of beauty pierce senses and the heart stills
A day-by-day dwelling through the mindsets of mass
A gray weary walk through the tunes of this plight
With compulsions of comfort composed by a reigning class
I long to be free from the desolate symphony of man’s delight
And to marvel at the passion that fills
When the root of beauty pierce senses and the heart stills
When an old haggard soul cross my way
From wounds of before dried up and bare
And new waters soak his spirit to fertile clay
For luscious life to sprout with sparkling dare
I marvel at this passion that fills
When the root of beauty pierce senses and the heart stills
From a place deep within the core of depravity
Ripples of damage rise and shake stability
Tearing up a world to die a debased cavity
Of famine, lust and greed which smiles, reveling its ability
Oh I crave the marvel of passion that fills
When the root of beauty pierce senses and the heart stills
I can no more refrain from calling His Name
He’s the only music to the silence of death
My Father, Friend and Christ who took our blame
Symphony of life and harmony of love
He is the marvel of passion that fills
The root of beauty piercing senses when our hearts stills
