SADNESS
stone walls all around, lifeless
walking through emptiness, cold as winter
tears surround like raindrops, puddles like floods
all around sorrows, sadness kills
eternity doesnt last forever, nothing does
hopes and dreams crushed, lost faith
feelings of things recoil, like life itself
winding down the hours, senceless pain
pushing all forward, losing everything
drowding like burning, hurting within
laughing like crying, undecided emotion
carefree under stress, live without sadness
