CALL IT A CLOWN
attire in blue
with linage of red,
walk like
in the cat bed of dream
in the night, poise
of sojourner bare
footed to catch the rain
in the sun
sweet pain
returns sacrifice the
tongue with thirst
in the sweeten
salt of ages rescue, find my dear
heart, bitter than
droplets of pain
in oblation of naked body
line
a tangle joy
of cloth in a shadow of self
esteem, for the
only thing that sees joy breathlessly
close the biting heart
to forgive
shout and joy
the clown dance with
the osmosis
of happiness, as humbly return
the beginning that forgive the
ages of
time
