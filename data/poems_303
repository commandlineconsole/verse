LOVE WHAT'S LOVE? ? ? ?
Love is just a word that i did not knew the meaning of before i met a special 'GUY'.
He showed me love even if it was not totally right
Love is deep
Love is special
Love is incontrolable
Love is magnificient
Love is strange
Love is joy
Love is pain
Love is mysterious
Love is crazy but before all that love is sweet and exquisite
Love made me a better person
Love turn me soft, lovable and loving
Love made me do things i thought i would never do
That's 'LOVE'
Love is just a word but that's my definition
Love is why i keep on hoping to have my love back
Love is why i keep on going and dreaming
Love made me happy and gentle
Love.........................
