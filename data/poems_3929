SOMETIMES I FIND IT HARD TO CARE
Sometimes i find it hard to care
If i was to take another breath of air
if i was to tie my shoes or comb my hair
Sometimes i find it hard to care
about what you have to say to me
about all the things you think i should be
about going out or what we're having for tea
Sometimes i wonder if i could care
about all of these would it make life easier to bare?
But i dont want to even try
cause then i would care about if i die.
