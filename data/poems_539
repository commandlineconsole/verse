A GIRL CALLED PASSION
Dreaming my life one day at a time,
Thinking of what I did was wrong or insane.
Thinking of you how you were always so true,
I know you was always in motions,
And someone told me you name is passion.
So I want you to know that I was born to love you,
Each day of my life is meant to be looking at the moon.
Love is like magic and it always will be,
My love still remains strong as never did.
Love works in ways that are passion and strange,
And there's nothing in life that love cannot change.
Passion can transform you Into beauty and splendour,
Your sweetness and grace can be always tender.
Your passion is unselfish, understanding and kind,
I love you with my heart and  with my mind.
Your passion is the answer that everyone seeks,
Passion  is the language, that every everyone speaks.
Dreaming my life one day at a time,
Thinking of what I did was wrong or insane.
Thinking of you how you were always so true,
I know you was always in motions,
And someone told me you name is passion.
