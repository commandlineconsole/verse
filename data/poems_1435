SILENCE 								VAVROOVAHANA PATRA
Silence reign sat night;
All creatures rest with delight.
Poet’s pen poems delightfully;
All derive mental peace gaily.
Night is freed from worries, anxieties;
Men, women rest with delight.
Devotees, poets live peacefully;
Pray goddess gleefully.
Night’s lap is silent;
People derive peace, merriment.
Poets derive peace at night;
Mind derives peace from silence with delight.
God’s creation is beautiful;
Creatures are delightful.
Anxieties vanishes from person;
Delightful becomes God’s creation.
Poet surrenders on the feet of mother;
She is life’s operator.
Is our Generator;
Is our path shower.
