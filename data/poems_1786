AMINU
Seek the truth and live with it,
The time has come for us to put things right;
Self-seekers and pleasure things,
I am now pregnant for you to be a father;
Selfishness and pleasure things,
I am now pregnant for you to be a father;
And it is now like an open book to you.
Marriage does change everything,
So let your voice be heard oh my sweet Aminu;
And try to be yourself always.
