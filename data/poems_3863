YOU HAVE TAKEN ME FROM FAR
Where was I
From mad to sand
Water to land
From gras to grace
You have taken me
From far
You were not even scared of me
You washed my body
From dark to bright
You have taken me from far
All that came from your love
Deep down of your heart
You care for me
Thousand of miles that where you were
Coming just for me
Without taking care of your life
You care for me
Inside your heart
Care for me
