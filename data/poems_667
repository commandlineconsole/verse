AS I MEET YOU
When I meet you  in thin air spread over a time
Yet ever extending, . I rock you in quest of love
You sneak to me to my soul  more deeper within
Shimmering like an angel with magical wings
You tune to my soul razzling over my passion
Engulfing me  and my whole being steeped in love
When  you slowly swaddle across the  the  youth
Driven by the will intemperate reasoned to the swing.
Yet I do not know reason that reasoned the love
That happens to happen as dew falling from night
And my enchanted soul ramified for searching upon
The smiles in response to my passionâ€™s light divine
