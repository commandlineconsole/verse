IN MY EYES
In my eyes
i see sadness
within that sadness
i see madness
in my eyes
i see tears
within those tears
i see painful years
in my eyes
i see protection
in that protection
is love and affection
in my eyes
i see love
and i am loved
by the god above.
in my MIND
i see my EYES
withing my MIND
i see your emotion and lies.
