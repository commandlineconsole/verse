FEAR
Fear is a footstep in the dark,
Or the wind moaning late at night.
Whistling by the cemetary, like a lark,
When the darkness overwhelms the light.
Fear is when you walk alone,
And every shadow makes you cry.
You can feel fear freeze your bones,
And your raspy throat goes dry.
Fear can make you lose your sense,
And stumble when you look away.
Or run headlong into a fence,
Sweating buckets, as you start to sway.
Fear can dominate your heart,
And leave you frozen to the spot.
Manage your fear from the start,
Don't let your fear fester, and turn to rot.
