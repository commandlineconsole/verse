WINDS OF PASSION
Sitting together in the twilight,
two hearts connected on the breeze,
like the petals and the bees,
the taste of mead from these winds of passion.
Walking together in the moonlight,
nonchalantly hand in hand and laughing,
two hands in the water splashing,
waves are revealed by the winds of passion,
When love encircles two souls,
and one caresses the other to please,
the whirlwind of delight buzzes across their knees,
a momentous palate in the winds of passion.
Lasting love warms like a summer day,
passing a moment in time eternally,
connected souls in perfect harmony,
a chalice containing their winds of passion.
