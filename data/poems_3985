CAN YOU BE MY NOBODY?
It's so cold and
It's so dark and
I'm so weak and
I wanted to cry but
I'm so afraid and
I am alone and
Can you be my Nobody?
Would it be fine baby?
I have a lot of money,
Do you want it honey?
I'll give it to you freely,
Be merely my Nobody
I'm almost tired for
Keep waiting for
Tears are falling and there's
I'm standing so strong
Don't want to feel wrong
For i know my Nobody will come along.
