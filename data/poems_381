PASSION
She is driven by the passions of life...
The passion in people, the passion of gods word and the strength of his lite...
She is driven by passion and the beauty in what she can see...
The passion in the strength of powerful waves brought in by the sea...
She is driven by passion and all she can feel, and the wiff of there scent...
The passion in the beauty of mountain tops, tall trees and the feeling of being heaven sent...
She is driven by passion and her passion is life in itself...
