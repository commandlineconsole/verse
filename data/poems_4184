EXPRESSING FAILURE
Failure is a fear of rejection
A fear for an average man,
Discontents illuminated by projection
Yes, failure's a fear of a lesser hand.
A fear for an average man,
The middle wants top, the bottom want less
Yes, failure's a fear of a lesser hand.
The middle want top, the bottom want less
If it's not so, that's one's abnegation
It's self-mutilation, never of a pythical nature
Yes, failure's a fear of a lesser hand.
