TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
To whom it may concern I write
I must make it clear to you
That I do not believe the news you say
I went to heaven  last night
To whom it may concern I write
I must say I feel just fine
Healthy as a horse if to be told
There must be a mistake somehow
To whom it may concern I write
I am just short my fifty two years
Far to young to pass away this way
In the prime of my life they say
To whom it may concern I write
I must say my aches and pains are gone
And Iâ€™ve never felt so light on my feet
There is something to say for that
To whom it may concern I write
I find myself in my favourite place
In a meadow full of wild daisies
I have never felt so content
To whom it may concern I write
I believe you may be right after all
I am in heaven like you say
The peace is overwhelming
To whom it may concern I wrote
I will miss my life on earth
But in heaven I am now an angel
To look after those I left behind
