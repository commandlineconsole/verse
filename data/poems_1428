BECAUSE
You’re shaking because you don’t know
what I’m going to say.
I’m shaking because I do know what I’m
going to say.
I love you.
You shake my heart.
You’re swaying because you know now
what I was going to say.
I’m swaying because you know now what
I was going to say.

You sway my mind.
You’re delighting because of what I have said.
I’m delighting because of what I have said.
I love you, because
You delight my soul.
