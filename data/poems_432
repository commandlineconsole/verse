PASSION
PASSION What's my passion?
It's me.

What's my passion?
It's love.

What's my passion?
It's You.

That my passion
becomes 'I love you'.

To love and embrace you is my dream.
To cherish you is a wish come tru
In my arms I hold you like my nokia
Not to let you escape but cover to protect you.

With this weather
I will be your perfect jacket
Get it on
and be warm for the whole season

Come on my Princess
You need not to suffer
Am here for you
For my passion is you.
