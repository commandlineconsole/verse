CUTTING YOU OUT
I let myself fall into a lie
I let my walls come down
I let myself smile and feel alive
I let my walls come down
No matter how I try I don't know why
You push so far away
You wrapped your hands tight around my heart
And squeezed it full of pain
With this knife I'll cut out the part of me
The part that cares for you
With this knife I'll cut out the heart of me
The heart that cares for you
I can't believe the way you took me down
I never saw the pain
Coming in a million broken miles
Like poison from my veins
With this knife I'll cut out the part of me
The part that cares for you
With this knife I'll cut out the heart of me
The heart that cares for you
With this knife I'll cut out the part of me
The part that cares for you
With this knife I'll cut out the heart of me
The heart that cares for you
The hate and the fear,
The nightmares that wake me up in tears.
The nightmares and the hate,
And the fear
The nightmares that wake me up in tears.
The nightmares and the hate,
And the fear
The nightmares that wake me up in tears
The nightmares and the hate
the last message i ever got from someone very special to me
