LIFE TIME OF HAPPINESS
I hope the days
That you'll spend together
May carries in it
Joy's flowers for you to gather
And may each year
That will pass you by
May collect for you
Dreams and hopes all high
I wish you long
And happy married life
Where smiles and happiness
And much joy survives
That can bring
Joy in your ways
To brighten your whole
Life time days.
CONGRATULATIONS FARAH & ARIF BHAI
