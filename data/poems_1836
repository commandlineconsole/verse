BITTER SWEET
Tonight I close my eyes
Tomorrow I will act surprised
The next day I will go
Remember you
The smell of your scent
That citrus and aftermath
The kindness in your eyes
The glow from your heart
The silk lining you promised me
The open door policy
Now I sit and act surprised
And reminisce
Nothing sweet but your lips
The smooth way your lips hit my hips
So bitter in love
So sweet in love
I close my eyes
Reflecting on the bitter and sweet way you made me feel
Nothing but darkness when you leave
Ill act surprised when you call me
Ill remember what you promised me in bliss
And act surprised when we kiss
When our day turns to night
We both might be in fright
What will we do?
Only one way
To keep up
Just act surprised
Bitter sweet memories
