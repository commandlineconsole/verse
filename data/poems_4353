I DONT WANT TO DIE ANY TIME SOON
I don't want to Die No Time Soon
"Though I walk through the valley of death,
I shall fear no evil"
But the Era I'm in now. Evil describes people.
So since Adam and Eve bit the apple, my
Life aint been peaceful.
What I fear? I fear death. And I could smell
It on every corner where them hood niggas rest.
What I fear? I fear pain. And I
Could still feel the medicine running
Through my veins. I smoke lime Kush
To function my brain.
What I fear? I fear patience, body under
the ground decomposing with my alignment
Adjacent, to another person, perhaps a patient.
It's way too many empty thoughts and silent
Screams that come to mind when it involves
Death & Me.
