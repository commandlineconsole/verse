: (INEVITABLE) :
Fear
Anger
These emotions are too much
Take away the pain
For they weigh heavy much.
Upon my fragile shoulders
I feel the weight begin to lift,
The knife has done its job
As my blood begins to drip.
Fear of being blamed
For a death that wasn't my fault,
Anger from my weakness
that the fear had brought.
Fear and Anger
Emotions I know so well
Have brought along the inevitable
As the puddle begins to swell.
