SADNESS AND GRIEF
Sadness and grief are not like horror, fear,
They are much lighter, don't press to ground,
Sadness and grief - are the necessary feelings
To live on earth, without any doubt.
When you are born, you can't avoid the grief,
If you lose the essential in life,
And sadness follows you for years,
Trying to tie you to the moments of light,
Where there was no grief and sadness...
That moments - are the miraculous creatures
Of the Reality and of the Mind...
And all in them - are closely united,
And at the same time distant and untied...
