JEALOUSY
It's like a drug
Once you have a hint of it
It consumes you
Becomes the master of your puppet body
Never to let you go
You cannot escape
When you see your special someone with that hated other
Even if only for a moment
You are filled with anger
The kind of anger that will never subside
It claws at you from your deep consciousness
Stays with you till death
Just like a drug
