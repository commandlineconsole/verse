HE DOES NOT CARE
i gave up a lot for someone..
he does know how much..
but he doesnt care..
i gave him all i could..
he accepted it...
but he took it and ran away..
he doesnt care
but when you love someone
you give to them..
you give up things for them
and i made a lot of sacrifices..
so many it has cost me almost everything
but he doesnt care
why would i do that
cause i loved him...
im not sorry for loving him
he doesnt care
im sorry because..
it was all part of his fantasy
his game...
and i was too dumb to see it
til it was too late
he doesnt care
now iv no trust
afraid of everything..
afraid of everyone..
he doesnt care
yes i love him still
but
he
does
NOT
care
about me
