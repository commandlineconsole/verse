NO ONE CARES
I'm alone,
Alone in a world where no one cares.
My love sometimes hurts me,
But seems not to care.
My friends all around me,
Ask what's wrong,
But I do not tell them,
I figure they do not need to care.
They tried to warn me about messin around,
But I would not listen,
I would not care.
My heart is ripping,
While my tears are dripping,
As I listen to the wind,
In a world where no one cares.
