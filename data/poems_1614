TREASURE OF HAPPY MEMORIES
Enjoy each second of your life
And learn to exist not just survive
And plan for each coming day
That comes passing by in your way
So each day that ends today
Can bring you some hope in a way
And leave behind it a great pleasure
Of happy memories that is a treasure
That colour your life with a colourful hues
And wipe away all your life's blues
So for that learn to collect this treasure
With happy memories to bring you pleasure.
