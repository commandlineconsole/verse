THE BREAKUP
Those eyes are the windows of your soul
lit by a shining light
dimmed by teardrops bright
searching for answers everywhere,
hoping for what is right
and I am, lost in those
twin pools of sadness.....
those eyes are the
tellers of many tales
our dalliances over hills and vales
reflections of days full of bliss
memories of many a stolen kiss
and I am lost in those twin pools of sadness
your eyes...
how can I part from you again
how can  our love be in vain
but go I must, as I know its right
even though you wont let go
without a fight
those eyes will snare me again
I am lost in those twin pools of sadness
It is time to say the goodbyes,
in different directions
our future lies
I shall remember you forevermore,
you are embedded in my very core
and I will never forget those eyes
twin pools of sadness, your eyes
