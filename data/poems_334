LOVE
Love is compassion
Love is gain
Love is not resentful
Love is insane
Love needs no explanation
No reason of being there
Love does not take offence
But still love cares
Love is always patient
Love is never selfish
Its one of life's many blessings
After learning life long lessons
Lust is my addiction
Love is my obsession
Your affection is my kryptonite
The frustration leaves me guessing
Love can be compassion
Love can be gain
Loves not always resentful
Love can be insane
