LET MY PASSION GROW
The passion of life,
We all agree it's a strife,
The passion of love,
Burning hot like a stove,
But your passion is something else,
A strange feeling; a special essence,
The torch that burned my old sorrows,
Your wisdom was like million arrows,
Straight to the point; always with a word,
But at the end, always just with your sword,
You, in front of whom I forever bow,
You; the one that makes my passion grow,
You are like my God; always merciful,
The love of Jesus, is your heart's rule,
You took me as a friend, me; as a lover,
But you loved more than a real brother...
Woman of mercy, the core of my world,
You'd known all my secrets; my sinful record,
But still treat me as a man of valor,
I'll be a good friend; you'll discover,
That my vow would be carved on the rocks,
My blessings will reach you like migrating flocks,
I'll keep this friendship in the marrow of my bones,
No doubt they'll reach the gates of the city of stones...
