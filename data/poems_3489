COMPLETE STAND
Age changes complete stand
From handsome father to a grand
A level superior to that of father
To look forward and expand further
Life nears to an autumn
Sometimes it causes concern
What would happen to my large kingdom?
But that is  taken care off or realized seldom
Face refuses to shine
Many changes occur with no teeth to dine
No good test from lavish food
The sign is well realized and understood
Do the heart beats die out gradually?
I suspect if some one says about it really
The heart beats and in order daily
To think of retirement from age point looks silly
There is rainbow of all colors
Only it must be liked and chosen with honor
Red may send you wish shivering
Green may have little peace in offering
Eyes refuse too look at shining moon
Even though it offers coolness soon
What is there in beauty with coolness?
The reddishness rushes on the face
There is no reason to mourn
Neither it should be laden with concern
Nor it should be taken as immediate turn
You are very much in world with desires to burn
I shall happily enjoy last moment
There is enough to enjoy with that is present
Love to live and expand to your liking
Nothing unusual may come at you for striking
