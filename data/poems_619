DESIRE
Descending upon thee,
You proposition and partake of  me
Silken ribbons of flesh
I offer myself to you
Do with me what you please
All your desires
Uncensored intense passion of emotion
savage sexual abandonment
At first glance
Unrestraint of Passions
Come, taste me
Ripe, sweet body of lust
Nectar made of me
A gift to quench your thirst
Liquid love dripping off my carnal body
Our sex...As we are engulfed
To be savoured
By the touch of your lips
The caress of your tongue
Come, love me
Pure undeniable longing
To have my body taken
Made one with yours
Posses me like no other
Enter my soul
Fill me with yourself
Ecstasy awaits us
