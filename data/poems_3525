POLITICIANS AND DEATH MAR 24TH,2011
I’m concerned about my own eventual future death,
And the lack of political concern about my last breath,
They couldn’t care less, when or where or how we die,
This couldn’t happen to them because it doesn’t apply.
It’s all because Death With Dignity is illegal here,
Therefore our pompous politicians barely look and leer,
But I’ve got news for them; they too will eventually die,
It may even be slow, long and painful amid their loud cries.
Therefore our eventual Death With Dignity should be discussed,
And why do our politicians view this subject with disgust?
We’re having an election but parties wont talk about this,
Some states have it: Oregon, Washington and or course the Swiss.
