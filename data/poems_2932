SORROW
Sorrow
By Renee’
Can you hear me?
Can you feel my pain?
Curse the day I was born
For this sad life leaves me so forlorn
On that day the world was filled with sorrow
I lay on the ground
Where all trample me down
I lay awake at nite
In my mind is this constant fight
Why? Why? Am I so filled with sorrow?
I can’t seem to find a reason
My heart has been filled with treason
Living with misery
Suffering in silence
This soul is filled with sorrow
I was born (sorrow)
I live (sorrow)
And I still live (sorrow)
I wish to die (No sorrow)
Then only will I be at peace
This tormented soul needs to decease
