CHASING THE DAY
~Dedicated To My Best Friend Legal-Eagle~
Taking the day by surprise
I shall wake before the sunrise
Vigorous chores
From here to there
I'll step up a notch
With a twist in the air
The dusk is upon my tail
Its not an option for me to fail
Chasing the day to no surprise
One day I will catch the sunrise
No more vigorous chores
Or having to run from here to there
To slow down just a notch
To slowly breathe the morning air
To sit and relax a moment on my tail
To be ok in life without fail
Chasing the day to no surprise
An invigorating adventure
In disguise
S.R.B.W.
