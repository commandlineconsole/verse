TO WHOM IT CONCERNS
To whom it concerns,
my life has just ended.
My body was weak,
'Pull the plug', recommended.
To whom it concerns,
my days were short lived.
I missed out on many things my friends did.
To whom it concerns,
I had many things waiting.
All the ones i loved,
Just sitting there, fading.
To whom it concerns,
I wish you all well.
The place where I died,
Is there place where I fell.
My eyes was crying,
and all full of burns.
I had no emotion,
To whom it concerns.
