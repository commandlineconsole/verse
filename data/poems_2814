MY FRIEND
I have a friend
Most think my friends perfect
They don't see the sadness
The emptiness inside
How my friend puts on a face
To hide the pain
I know the pain
the guilt
the hurt
the sadness
Don't cry anymore I'm here
Don't look away and hide
Come out and play
Show me yourself
Let me in and I promise to hold you
This goes to my friend
You have someone who loves you
for you
not for the perfection
not for the looks
not for anything but you
