REALIZATION
We feel  our self very proud and happy
When our parent realize that they care for them.
Can we really reciprocate them   only  few
People withstand on this ideology
and  rest of us ignore their goodwill gesture
to our surprise when some one show sign of care
other than parent, we not only quickly realize but also try to do
reciprocate them immediately  and remember them for long.
why we are so indifferent toward our parents?
we  neither  realize nor reciprocate and forget them.
simple because they care us and share in our every painful moment!
why care of other carry more weight than care of  your own parent?
may be, we feel responsibility factor in parent care
and care by other is a part of selfless service without any reward-â€˜O' Really! ! .
