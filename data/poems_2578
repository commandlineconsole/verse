PUT AWAY YOUR SADNESS
Put away your sadness
Save it for the day of grief
which comes though we bid it not
Sadness has no place
in the blessed day
when health is ours
and children play
abandoned to life
in their hungry way...
Put away your sadness
live this blessed day
How would you answer
Him who gave you breath
for this very day,
if squandered to sadness
you threw the day away?
