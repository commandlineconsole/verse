GIVE ME YOUR LOVE
Always thought dawn should be at sunset
That's when things come to life
The best teacher I ever had was experience
All the rest cut like a blunt knife -dull
Give me your love, and I'll give you sunsets, moonlight nights on foreign shores
Give me your love, and I'll teach you about life tonight and more, that's for sure
And fill you with delight, show you things that will surprise you, open your eyes, to tantalize you
Give me your love
Never thought politicians were very honest
Always spoke before they new the truth
Short term fixated agendas
Walking on glass, barefoot, uncouth
Give me your love, and I'll give you honesty, as pure as light, from the stars
Give me you love, and I will build you a future better than any you've had, so far
And fill you with delight, show you things that will surprise you, open your eyes to tantalize you
Give me your love
Never knew a banker who wasn't greedy
Always had a tarnished soul
'Paulus curate', no responsibility shared
Still asking for more money even after been shown out the door
Give me your love, and I'll give you integrity to last a thousand years
Give me you love, and I'll show you responsibility and take away all your fears
And fill you with delight, show you things that will surprise you, open your eyes and tantalize you
Give me your love
