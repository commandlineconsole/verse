BITTER-SWEET MEMORIES
Sorrow played its melodies,

sometimes slow, sometimes fast,
happiness coming and passing,
Sorrows never long-lasting.
Until a day, like no other day,
a heart-stopping blow
reduced me to tears of unending
flow.
Sorrow knew no boundaries,
endless tears brought no relief,
but flourished in their salted grief.
As time went by,
Sorrow wore a gentler face,
a blameless one I could embrace.
Sometimes slow and achingly sad,
sometimes fast, brimming with joy,
Sorrow plays its bitter-sweet memories
of long-ago.
