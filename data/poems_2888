SADNESS PART 2
The dagger known as sadness digs in deeper
Walking around these memories as a sleeper
The bleeding hasn't stopped since you left
Drained of my happiness from this cruel theft
If you long for one thing for so long
You'll miss other things along the way
The dagger a stone of sadness falls in deeper
Walking I freeze in these memories as a reaper
The needing hasn't dropped since you left
Restrained of my happiness, this fool you left
How many things have I missed on my way
As I longed for you to return to me
