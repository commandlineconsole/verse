ORDINARY MOMENTS
Longing for a quiet time to return
When simple pleasures reigned supreme
A hectic pace, now somehow burns
My candle at both ends, but how I dream
Of special days that brought pleasure
Having time to stroll to favorite places
Hours that were free, I failed to measure
With time elapsed, missing familiar faces
I often envy nature, and how things are ordered
Everything has a purpose and a time to shine
So often we find our lives are disordered
Needing to proritize, before we fall behind
