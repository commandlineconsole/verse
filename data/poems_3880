UNTITLED
You say I hurt you
You say u care
But caring is an action
An action you lack
You care about you and what
Puts a smile on your face
You wonder why I'm down round you
Well if you cared I'd be different
But since you don't go head and do you
I still love you n want the best for you
But don't drive me to hell so you can see glory
May God bless you and my heart
So I won't be bitter
But I refuse to be the gum
On the bottom of your shoe
Just say the words and I'm gone
