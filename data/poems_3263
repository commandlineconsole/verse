EYES THAT CALL OUT FOR HELP
the sad eyes cry out for help in the dark hole of madness and the eyes are covered with sadness her hole life and then you look deep down in her eyes you see a woman that has been trapped and berried alive in hopeless life where it makes it a life time full of unhappy sorrowfulness madness and drama becomes so unreal but then again there you go theres that wall keeping people from seeing really seeing your sad and lonely self. the eyes show it all but when you look deep in to those eyes all you see is a dead cold black hole.
