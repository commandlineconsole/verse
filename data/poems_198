“WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED LOVE”
Title borrowed from Cole Porter
Some love a winter’s walk
Too many others love to talk
Most of us love a classic movie
Love to do things considered groovy
We love our spouse and love our mothers
We love our sisters and of course our brothers
Love the songs Sinatra sings
We seem to love all manner of things
Some love to smoke and love to drink
Love to receive a flirtatious wink
In our love-smitten society
Emotional love has much variety
So I’ve come to my loving conclusion
The meaning of love is pure confusion
