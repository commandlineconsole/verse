VAIN FRIGHT
Fear not the guns
all must come to dust
nor the strange sounds of war
nor the wailing stomach behind doors.
Fear not the sky
though she harbors strange lights;
Fear not the seas
though her waves pierce in deep.
Our lives become naught
under the glaring eyes of the dust;
Fear not the Giants
who conquer and the divide.
Fear not misery
Fear not gloom;
The Earth history
our lives obey no rule.
Pride and hate must surely tango
that is all our mortal soul can be thankful;
Fear not the stormy nights
though her eyes be fiery outcast;
Fear not the morning dews
though she sprinkles strange news.
Our mortal soul must surely conform
to the fiery note of the dust;
Our eternity definitely certain
all fear must belong to the heathen.
Fear not the spills of blood
a sacred thought she wore;
Fear not Divine creeds
our lives ever greater than his.
Fear not the Trees
they stand tall to our every need;
Fear not the star
soothsayers shall never decipher.
Our lives an earthly price
our souls the Divine's pride;
Standeth we as gods
fear not earth's laws.
Fear not the moon
her eyes forever lay gloom
her light not hers
fear not her sounds.
Fear not the sun
though she radiates strange songs;
Fear not her heat
our lives great in defeat.
Lift away all insane thoughts
fear not the dust.
she harbors strange fields
where our lives will be laid in her keep.
Fear not poverty
it is all we have to keep;
Supplications must forever abound
our lives never in disguise.
