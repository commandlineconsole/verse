LOVE
Love is not a toy
Love is not a game
Love is not something you can just throw away
Love is a feeling you should cherrish
Love will not always be easy
Love will sometimes hurt
Love will be like a cloud in the sky
Love will disappear and never come back
Love can be the greatest feeling
Love can make you feel warm inside
Love can be just like a windy breeze
Love can just come and go
Love might be confusing
Love might kick you to the curve
Love might also give you hope
Love is out there for the taking
