LOVE GOT MANY NAMES AND MEANINGS
Love got many names and meanings
Sing by lover hearts
My love has other meaning
Not in the dictionary or glossary
My  love isn’t story or  a novel
My  love isn’t a poem of pendants seven
My  love is more affections then Laila and Qais
My love is stronger than Antar and Abla
Greater than the love of Romeo and Juliet
Love you my heart  princess
New love, renewed every moment
Love would never grow old
Immortal love
I love my love
This poem is gift for my sweet wife for her brithday, best and sweet wish Umri, love you
