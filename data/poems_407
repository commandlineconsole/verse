PURIFYING PASSIONS
Passion is built
on the soul's intent
Formed by the focus
of the mind
Shaped with the heart
and it's beloved facets
The mere endeavors
sculpt the internal being
opening eyes
to the problematic
evil passions
dwelling in others
Push past
these fellows' faults
not with judgment
but a clarifying
innovation
made of pure passions
that are resolute
in the Perfecter's mind
Bringing light
to a darkened soul
is the basis
of true passion
that ought to
burn with zeal
in the heart
of the lovers of the Lamb
So burn on
avid adventures
with not your own
but God's will
lifting your chins
one by one
