WOW
You have been my friend for three years.
You have cared for me for three years.
You have shown interest in me for three years.
Now that I am free you still look at me with such eyes that
Tell me you care.
You have waited for so long and now a month longer you
Will need to wait.
When the month has expired you will be able to hold me in
Your arms for you are the one I want closest to me.
You are the one that has always cared and I have always
Cared for you.
Will we last, will we be able to continue on the
Journey that we will start?
If so, will you allow me to attach to you, for I care.
Will you always be there for me?
You can show the world you care when this month is over.
