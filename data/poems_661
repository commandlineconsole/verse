GRACIOUS GRACE
Gracious is the Grace that favored me thus
When I knew Him not, my heart yet hardened
Merciful is the mercy that found me hither
Renewed me within, when I sought Him not
And this is the Love that transformed me
And rights my wrongs and renews my heart
To guide my footsteps, to inflame my passion
To love what He loves, to hate what He hates
My heart so awakened, my mind thus renewed
My passion now aright, my life daily revitalized
Now death has no dread and life no doldrums
As each day an adventure, each moment a quest
Of joyous awakenings, of wonderful endeavors
Passionate engagements and daily discoveries
