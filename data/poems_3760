WASTE AND RHYME
no one cares
no one realizes their mistake
all absorbed in their own world
not noticing the impact they make
the ones who won't listen
are the ones that don't care
not caring what you have to say
not caring what you have to share
and when they don't care
they aren't worth your time
so don't waste your words on them
and don't waste them on a rhyme
