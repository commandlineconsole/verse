A THING OF BEAUTY
Keats once claimed that beauty
Shall always be a joy.
But how—I ask—can this, then, be—
When beauty often fades?
What, then, is the source of beauty?
Shall that e’er fade away?
If no more beauty we can see—
Does that joy go away?
I say that beauty lies in the soul—
Not always in the face.
When – with joy—a heart is full
Can beauty ever fade?
