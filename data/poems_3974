TO MY BOYFRIEND
For days and months, it hasn't been easy
For hours and seconds, i'm longing for you

AzZ, you made my world came true,
You made sure everything was fine
I just knew that you could look out for me
I dnt care if ur lazy bum
i dnt care if ur different
i dnt care if ur malaysian
i dn care no i dnt care
i only care coz' i feel different when i'm with you
i feel safe, i feel secure, i could trust u anytime whenever

For days and months, it hasn't been easy, no
For hours and seconds, i'm longing for you, yh

Since i left, i thought its all over
Sobbing onto the ground, i didn't know what to do
Since i left, it was the most painful thing ever
AzZ you know i never meant to hurt you, no
i never wanted to leave like that no
Yet i feel relieved when i hear from you
Yet you were there,
sticking by my side each day

And for that
So plz hang in there
i will always love u forever and ever
and dnt let me down
