WHAT MUST IT BE LIKE
What must it be like o fly high above
To be care free and never touch the ground
To kiss the clouds and feel the rain
What must it be like to fly
What must it be like to breathe
To take in and conceive pain
To smell the roses and the rain
What must it be like to breathe
What must it be like to live
To feel the joy and sorrows
To see what has been born
What must it be like to live
What must it be like to die
To see the light and touch the sky
To feel no more pain and sorrow
What must it be like to die
