SISTERS, JOY AND SORROW
How to express that which
cannot be put into words
I could write how do I love thee
all day long and still not convey
how I feel about you
Yeats' wrote of Joy and Sorrow,
sisters, each ready to step in
and take their place at your side
How quickly one can go
from the heights of joy
to the depths of sorrow
I have been intimate with
both sisters and right now,
Sorrow is my mistress
How I wish for Joy
to return to my life
How I long for you my muse.
