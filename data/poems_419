OUR LOVE
Love
Our love
Like the exquisite beauty of a perfect rose
Ageless, timeless,  it knows no bonds  -  no bounds
Passion
Our passion
Burns with the intensity of the purest flame
Primal, eternal,  it is unbridled  -  untamed
Joy
Our joy
Like the melodic strains of an angelic choir
Weaving, haunting,  it reaches deeper  -  higher
Passion
Our passion
Pulses with the urgent beat of an innocent heart
Drumming, calling,  it must be heard  -  and felt
Love
Our love
like the powerful surge of lightning in the clouds
Pure, absolute,  it fused our lives  -  our souls
