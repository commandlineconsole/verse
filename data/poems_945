A BIG BRIGHT DREAM
There is a glimpse of morn on the sky
Where dark clouds are floating high
So look to it and hope to see
A big bright dawn appearing for thee
For life is a mixture of joy and sorrow
Where appears dull and bright morrow
So don't sit back and think dear
That joy and pleasure are commodity rare
For everyone is given his share
Of both smile's  joy or pain's tear
So don't feel bad and hope to see
A big bright dawn appearing for thee.
