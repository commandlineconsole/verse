PAIN WITH OUT LOVE.
'pain, pain in love' Papa roach will be the pilot of my emological coach. He'll drive me off a cliff to see whats not to be heard. Teach me what is not to be learned. Worry about whats not of our concern. Leaning from our mistakes before its our turn. Will our people ever learn? Don't worry, it's not of our concern.
