CRY BABY FOR WORLD PEACE
Cry baby cry make them listen and heard
Cry to mama cry to papa
Cry to friend’s people and theworld
Make them heard your cry
You are hungry in pain and sadness
Hunger without food the selfishness takes all
Pain to see and heard so much heartiness and uncared
Sadness of war and killing because of domination and hatred
Please mama feed my hunger
Please papa heal my pain
Please friend’s people theworld cure my sadness
