THE OFFER
The world's your abyss of sorrows.
Sorrows never lost in space.
The world's my abyss of joy.
Joy that spreads through eternity.
My joy will never dim or die,
But lighted will it stay for I,
Who has nothing but my joy.
It's all I have and all I want,
And all I'll ever need.
You needed help, I offered help,
But still you pushed away.
You still need help, so here I am,
To offer what you need.  So take
This now and feel the joy I've
Offered unto thee.
