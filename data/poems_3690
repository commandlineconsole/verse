WHY DO I CARE?
Why do i care that you always break my heart?
Why do i care about all the fights you start?
Why do i care about all the times you have hurt me?
Why do i care about how you yell and beat me?
Why do i care that you always let me down?
Why do i care that you will never turn around?
Why do i care that you will never change?
Why do i care that your brain will never re-arange?
Why do i care about all the hurtful things you say?
Why do i care about each and every day?
why do i care that i can't leave right now?
Why do i care that i don't really know how?
