ALL RULES END
We cannot say what there was
Before time itself began
We cannot speculate with any certanty
Before that singularity
So you should not ask me
Of what came before our time began
You should not be concerned by what I did
Before you were my universe
Those questions have no answers
The answers have no meaning
The meaning makes no sense
There's no sense in questioning
I am not concerned with what you've done
In who you've seen or known
Before our first big bang
It has no baring on what came after
Those questions will not be answered
For the answers have no meaning now
Not in these lives...
