SET ME FREE
Sadness heart that go away,
Some might will be lost in this decay.
Sadness cold inside their heart,
That would rip them apart.
The cry of pain will kill them all,
They deserve it, they deserve to fall.
And when the true they will see
They knows nothing ever will set them free.
Heartless is empty space around me,
Cut me loose or set me free
Don't leave me here in this humid wall.
I'm mortal and I'm a fool.
Restless days are coming ahead,
Let me breathe and don't leave me here dead.
Sadness heart that go away,
some might will be lost in this decay.
Sadness cold inside their heart,
That would rip them apart.
The cry of pain will kill them all,
They deserve it, they deserve to fall
