EINSTEIN (1)
(To enjoy the song for this poem, please see the poet's profile for the website.)
Whatever the observer may observe in whatever place,
It is believed that all scientific rules have the same base.
So, the universe is understandable and works with a grace
That surprised Einstein, who later surprised the human race.
