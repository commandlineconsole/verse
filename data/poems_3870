DON'T CARE ABOUT ME
People ask me
What's the matter?
I tell them
Nothing
Just to protect them from the truth
That lies in my eyes
If the cared
They'd stop caring
They keep asking
What's the matter?
I answer to my friend
But the rest keep pestering
I wish the wouldn't
I wish they knew
If I told them
The truth would be exposed
And they'd never look at me the same
So please
Stop caring
If you care
About me
