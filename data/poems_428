PASSIONS DEEP
Your passion burns so very deep,
Like secret dreams when you sleep,
The passion burns so deep inside,
Such deep desires that you hide,
What can I do, what can I say?
Let your passion come out and play.
Like a wild, caged up beast,
Your passions need to be released,
Will it take a kiss to your lips?
Or the gentle touch of my fingertips,
I want you in my arms to hold,
As your passions start to unfold.
You've hid your passion for too long,
Now in my arms is where you belong,
As we hold each other close and tight,
And enter into this passionate night,
Something that is so long overdue,
Time to release the passionate you.
