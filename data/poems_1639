COLOURFUL DREAMS
I feel some work of colour in the head,
Itâ€™s a description of your pleasure.
The colours sound different like a rainbow,
But your bending of the light is so.
Wondering and labouring is like sleeping,
Circumstances change for the picture.
May the rainbow seem frowning
On your pleasure and dream, how majestic!
The dreams grow and grow
In the infinite realm, where there is a nonsense-land.
