SELFISH SOUL
I am a selfish soul
I don’t see the sorrows around
I don’t hear the cries
I just curse the system to change
What good did I do to change
I am a selfish soul
Am I even worthy to comment
If I myself refuse to change
I don’t even smile at people
Why do I expect them to smile
I am a selfish soul
I am living inside a cocoon
Pretending to be a happy soul
Not accepting the evils around
What good am I if I don’t change
I am a selfish soul
Why do people fight I ask
Without wanting them to stop
I don’t really care for anyone
Unless it is someone my own
I am a selfish soul
Why should I wait for a saviour
Why do I even care for a change
As long as I am happy in my mask
Why do I need a change
I am a selfish soul
The miseries around make me think
But time heals everything
Those who loose they suffer
As time passes sorrows get lesser
I am a selfish soul
World filled with crooks and lies
Who cares who cries and who dies
I don’t have time for anyone
I am happy in my wicked mask
I am a selfish soul
Whats all these disease and filth
All the crippled and the sick
As all day I merry around
Little I care whats going around
I am a selfish soul
Why should I care you beg for bread
Why do I care that you even eat
As long as I got my share of meat
What do I care whats your fate
I am a selfish soul
Little I care if on road you sleep
What do I care that you, even sleep
As long as I have my roof
I don’t care you cry or weep
I am a selfish soul
What do I care whose cries are these
As long as I am happy I care the least
I am a selfish soul
I am a selfish soul…………………
