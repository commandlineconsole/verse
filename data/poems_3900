I THOUGHT YOU CARED
I thought you cared
When I played sport
But you wanted to see me hurt
I thought you cared
When I succeeded in life
But you just wanted to see me fail
I thought you cared
When I loved you
But you just wanted to use me
I thought you cared
When I gave you my heart
But all you did
Was break it apart.
