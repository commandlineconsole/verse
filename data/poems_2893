SURROUNDED IN BLACK ROSES
It is a day of love and sadness
Love red
Sadness black
I long your rose, ballon and teddy that says those words
One million girls would like to hear from you
One million
But only one does truely love you back
Valentines never meant something to me until
You came
Now i am awaiting your expressions of love to me
Still Waiting Still waiting
I guess that you forgot
Well i dont blame you
With me surrounded by black roses
Who would remember me
