THIS UNDESERVING HEART
The wind blows across your face
And as the hair blows away from your eyes I see the truth
Your eyes that are so clear
And so deep
I lose myself within them
So crystalline…
I forget the words I want to say
The anger I want to show you
The damage you have caused
The damage that torments me everyday…
You’ve broken my spirit,
Ripped my heart out
And placed it, still beating,
On the slaughtering block
And people have lined up
And waited for their turn
To slam their hammer made of
Hate
Judgment
Accusation
Anger
Hurt
Fear
