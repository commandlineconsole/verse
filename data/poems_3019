PAIN AND RAGE AND HURT
Pain and rage and hurt.
Erline has to feel bad too.da ya think//? ? +.
Pain the feeling of sorrow...
Rage the feeling of sorrow...
Hurt the feeling of sorrow...
The felling of sorrow is:
Pain
Rage
Hurt
Sorrow
The feeling is not bliss,
it feels something like this.
The absence of a kiss.
What you gave to me.
Instead of my love returned.
Instead of.
My kiss.
Charles Robert Hice
