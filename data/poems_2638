A WORD OF SADNESS
that is a word of sadness
it could never be forgotten once you hear it
though you don't understand what I said
your heart will feel it for you
there's sadness, painful yearning
there's cold snow that never melt
there's eternal silence, sweet and sting
we keep wailing, even after we're gone
and our children children  suffer this fate
we will never forget
even we have forgotten
because every breath we take
every pale morning comes from east
we get living
with losing them
that is a whisper
a word of sadness
