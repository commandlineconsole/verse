MUJHSE PAHLI SI MAHABBAT MERI MAHBOOB NA MANG BY FAIZ AHMED FAIZ
Do not expect of me, my beloved, the same old love
Life once appeared beautiful because, I thought, you were there
The sweet longing for you made me forget other worldly pains
The spring seemed eternal because of your splendid beauty
What else remained in this world besides your lovely glance?
Fate would have been conquered If I had won you
It was not exactly like this, though I thought it was true…
There are other sufferings in this world, my beloved, besides love
There are other pleasures besides the pleasure of lovers' embrace
Evil spells of savagery spread over countless ages…
Woven in silk, satin and gold lace
Bodies put up for sale in the markets and byelanes
Smeared with soil, bathed in blood
Bodies emerging from cauldrons of virus
Putrid pus oozing from rotting wounds
I keep looking that way too, what can I do
You still look enchanting but what can I do…
There are other sufferings in this world, my beloved, besides love
There are other pleasures besides the pleasure of lovers embrace
Do not expect of me, my beloved, the same old love…
