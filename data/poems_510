LIFE AND DEATH?
O'death does bring the saddened passion
to eyes that cry with grief's great pain.
Pain does steal in eager fashion ~
for life that never breathes again.
And yet for every life that's passing
onto the heaven's golden shore ~
another soul is earthly borning,
passing safely through life's door.
O'life does bring the gleeful passion
to eyes that shine with life's great gain.
Gain that glows in eager fashion
from life that breathes time and again.
And yet for life or deathly passion
onto the sand of timely shore,
another soul is sharply keening ~
to live or die forevermore.
O'life and death does bring great passion
to eyes that cry for pain or gain.
Gain that lives in earthly fashion.
Pain that lives within death's reign.
Yet every life will see the sunset.
Eyes will cry with grief's great pain ~
as earthly borning brings the sunshine
when life evolves to live again.
