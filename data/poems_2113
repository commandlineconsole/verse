LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES
Life, is certainly, full of surprises,
there are new things happening,
everyday! It may be hard, to keep
up with these occurrences, but we
do our best, come what may. Some
I can say, are happy ones, which all
of us like to get, then there are those,
I'd like to propose, we try very hard, to
forget! We'd much rather look forward,
to good things and take every bit of it
in., for who needs to worry and get
ourselves, in a tail spin! If there are to
be surprises, may they always be, of
the very best kind. Now, I feel so much
better, because I got, a load off of my
mind!
