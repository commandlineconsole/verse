MUSIC AND LOVE EVERYWHERE
I'll bring out the charge of the love brigade,
It's winter in the air once again,
Once a year it'll come again,
The songs of Christmas in a parade
Giving out all the joy to all,
Give a little love and joy to you,
Take a little love and joy from me,
I want to share it with you
The bells will be ringing,
With music and love everywhere,
The joy ness of being happy,
Will be fun like a happy millionaire
