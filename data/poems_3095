A HEART FELT, SORROW'S SONG.
Music to my ears are your words of love, meant only for me....
The rythmic movement of your heart for mine, is the only readable sign to thee...
For how so ever may my heart endure your parting sorrows, as if more denials sweep me fast...
Sweep me closer to sorrow's dispair, of a sorrow that I'll not wish to repeat...
For in repeating a sadness oh shaped moon, only hovers to remind me long to last, of a horrid sphered too close and deep to heart.
Remembering all too well that torturious part, of that morning a mourning's depart....
Depart depart this shallowed red organ, slit in two halves, to impel sorrow, to both our hastening feeling's real...
Reel me closer to a movement to feel....
That tasted pain-ever so real.
An anguished heart not meant to heal.
