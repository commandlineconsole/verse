I DON'T NEED YOUR......
I don’t need your anger
or your hate
and I sure don’t need your temper
I have my own
thanks to living with you
I don’t need your stress
I don’t need your problems
I have enough of my own
i don't need your pity
i don't want to see your reaction
i don't want to fight with you
i am sick of living like this
i am sick of living a life full of anger and pain
