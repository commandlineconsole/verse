PAIN-FILLED ANGER
Oh! What is this?
Pain inside my heart,
Maybe it's anger...
A vibrant twist of both...
Red anger pouring out,
Raindrops pouring down
From my bloodshot eyes.
Oh! What is this?
Emptiness,
Running short of emotion...
No more pain,
No more anger,
Coming up empty...
It's like everything's leaked out
Red numbness pouring out
In order to feel something
And raindrops
Don't feel my eyes anymore...
I feel nothing,
Emotions run dry,
I want to feel something,
Anything at all...
But coming up empty
Is all I seem to have.
It's just not fair...
It's all coming back,
An ache in my heart,
Anger filling my body.
I'd rather have this
Than feel numb,
But red anger pours out
Once again
As raindrops feel my eyes
Once again.
Raindrops fall down to my dirty,
Beat up shoe.
Pain and anger,
So much,
Red stains now feel my mattress.
So, I'll listen to the beat
Of my favorite band
Because it seems
To be the only thing
That will keep my mind occupied
From all this anger and pain
And I'll fall asleep,
Headphones in my ear,
So my anger won't
Win me over,
At least for tonight.
