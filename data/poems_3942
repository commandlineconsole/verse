SOMEONE UNKNOWN
To be happy for someone you care is a blessing
Blessing in a way that it gives satisfaction to heart
Care sometimes takes form of love
Which is very pleasing to be.
I guess this feeling of care is hard to explain
Even though it makes the heart very happy
Why does this heart fear loving?
Answer to this is never ever known
Love and care is always so pure
I guess, the answer is simple
I fear love, since I never received enough of it
When, I did love my heart was shattered
It broke me and turned into someone unknown.
