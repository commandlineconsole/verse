AT TWILIGHT THE SADNESS COMES
AT TWILIGHT THE SADNESS COMES
At Twilight the Sadness comes
Less Light
The fading of the world
Trees too less Green
And where to go?
Where to go?
Later it will change.
Perhaps.
The bright light of street lamps
Against the Blackness.
But now for these moments
Everything feels
As if it has lost all its meaning
And is about to Die.
I too in my Tiredness
am like the Twilight now
Soon I will be 66 years of Age.
