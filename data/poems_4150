FEAR
If the only thing to fear is life itself
Why do people fear things other than life itself
Is it because they are afraid of the challenges that come with life
Or that fear will cut their through their hearts like a knife
Better yet are they scared of what they can achieve
Forcing the failure to believe
In what life has in store
Finding that their dreams have washed ashore
Since fear is a sign of weakness
People with fear are facetious
But everyone has a fear deep inside
That sometimes forces them to hide
Behind a mask
So they can avoid finishing last
Fear is the root of all evil
Because fear has been the downfall of many people
Fear can cause the impossible
And can even be unstoppable
Only fear what you can control
Then you will control what the future holds
