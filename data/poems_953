ME
Peace is what my soul yearns 4,
peace is what i long 4,
peace is the cure 2 my pain....
love is what i have,
love is what i receive,
love is what i live...
joy resides in me,
joy am willing 2 give,
joy drives me...
respect is in my every move,
respect defines me,
respect collects me...
me is who i am,
me is the soul within,
me is the woman i am.
