MY SORROW
My Sorrow
This sorrow, blind's me, hurt me.
When I rain fall I watch while it dropp to the ground, and wishing this pain go away.
I can't escape from pain that I am feeling.
I would like to go far, far away from here.
I am on top of a hill looking down at the beautiful graveyard.
I am wishing I was there.
I started heading back to home and hoping the pain of this sorrow would go away.
I lock myself in my room.
I watch the rain fall again and again hoping the rain take me away from here.
I want to go far away from this sorrow that is eating from the inside.
I am wishing the rain could wash away my pain.
I hating this feeling that has came over me.
This life is meaningless.
This life is worthless.
Take me away from here.
Take me far, far away.
Please take me away rain.
Wash away my pain.
Wash away my sins.
I want to be like the water.
Water has no pain.
Water has no sorrow.
Water has no worries.
Just peace.
I need peace.
I don't need this sorrow.
I don't need this pain.
I want this pain to end.
I want to be like the rain.
I am tired of living.
I am tired of this pain.
I am tired of being here.
I want just eternal peace. ï»¿
