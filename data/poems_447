AND WHAT OF PASSION?
Can it be passion
That gives meaning to joy
Which results in emotions
Excelling in ardent employ?
Passion is wholly
Transforming, it transcends
Then creates sacred fires
In the heart that burn without end.
Chaotic and wild
At times it obsesses
But acts out deep fantasies
With a profound zeal - nothing less.
Rapturous passion
Exults in desiring
Each day's opportunity
To infuse spice into it's fire.
Passion means living
To fullness our loving,
Giving all to another
With unrestrained fervour as proof.
Primordial life
Inspires every heartbeat
With pure authenticity.
Pulsating energy defeats
Boredom - -
Passion is unbeatable.
