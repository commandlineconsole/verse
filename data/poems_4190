MY LOVE
Oh I have fears of loving
Too much
And getting hurt
I have fears of committing
Of not resisting
I have fears
Oh
So many fears
But love can change
The world
This I believe
Love can change
Even me
So for love I am
Facing my fear
Full on
As a matador faces
The bull
Because I know
My love’s arms
And
My love’s kisses
Are waiting
So I place my fears
In the past
And move forward to
A great future
And
My Love
