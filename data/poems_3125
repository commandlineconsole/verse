A CHILD'S DEATH
God the Lord has taken
Though He has given too;
For in your times of sorrow
God shows His love for you.
God's love will bring you joy
God's joy will never cease
'cause when you know the love of God
You then know inward peace.
These words I speak to you dear friends
To quieten all your fears;
For by God's Spirit your sorrow I share
I've prayed for you with tears.
And as I prayed God's Spirit groaned
Within my troubled breast,
God told me it was 'by His love
that he would give you rest.'
Your sorrow will be turned to joy
You shall find peace I know
'cause when you seek the risen Christ
His love constrains you so.
Let us praise God for His giving
And for His taking too;
For in your times of sorrow -
God makes known His love for you.
2 Samuel 12: 19-23; Luke 4: 18,19
(written for a couple whose infant died)
