HOLDING IT IN, BUT TRYING TO GET IT OUT
so much pain in me
so much hurt in me
so much sadness in me
holding it in, but trying to get it out
with every tear i cry
with every slit
i feel it leave my body
but every time i see you
more gets put back in
cuz of that one night
cuz of what you did
i am in pain
i am in hurt
i am in sadness
holding it in, but trying to get it out
filled with pain
filled with hurt
filled with sadness
is crushing me down
weighting me down
but cuz of you all of this pain
will never leave my body
and it will cush me till i am dead.....
