SORROWS
Crying,
Lieing,
Beatin
Dieing,
Sorrows have stopped my wings from flying.
The darkness still remains in my lungs
still not lifted or burnt in the sun
My life is still incomplete
but im almost ready to go in to a deep sleep
Crying,
Lieing,
Beatin
Dieing,
Sorrows have stopped my wings from flying
Awayfrom the darkness that has kept me alive
But how I feel now I think I already died.
so here you leave me
Crying,
Lieing,
Beatin
Dieing,
Sorrows have stopped my wings from flying
Nevermore
Never again,
goodnight.
Forever  remain in
sorrows.
