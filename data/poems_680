PERFECT LOVE
The love we was searching for
We have now found
We make each other strong
We make each other weak
Melt into our passion
That I soul does seek.
I know we are each others desire
We will light each otherâ€™s fire
As we look into each others eyes
We see the passion that burns inside
As we caress each others soul
We feel the flames that we both hold.
