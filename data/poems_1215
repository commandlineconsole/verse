FIRST  RAIN.
The heat simmered on the ground,
Road, all around, with the hot air
Blowing with a vengence,
When it grew dark, by the dark clouds,
Suddenly it started rained titter, pitter,
The air smellimg sweet with wet ground
The smell thrilling the nostrils,
Trees dropping droplets of water,
From the fresh rain,
Small rivulets on the ground,
The month long wiat of the ground,
Being on it, blessed for more,
The first rain came again,
As a welcome visitor,
Like all the years, but  fresh and newer
Again, to the delight of the mind,
The thoughts of life's misery
Temprorarily to be replaced,
By new hope and delight.
