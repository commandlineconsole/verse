I BACKDOWN
Gently my soul seek you no more
I backdown into the darkness
called your past
Where I will not be there to experience
all that will befall you
I backdwon into my loneself
where I will derive joy
In whatever and whoever I choose to be
And so I say goodbye
never or maybe you will look back
and see my burning heart for you
with joy will I watch over the window
and pray; you find peace, love and joy
