I DID NOT WANT TO WRITE POEMS OF SADNESS
I DID NOT WANT TO WRITE POEMS OF SADNESS
I did not want to write poems of sadness
But when sadness takes over oneâ€™s life?
The words are what the feelings are
They can try to be better
But ultimately
The true poem is the feelings
And now at this moment
Sadness is the poem
Sadness which waits for the morning light
And prays to God it will be truly ligh
