TO FORSAKE OR TO LOVE  	II
Understand human! understand human! understand human!
At times the hands that care do not embrace our soul strongly
Yet within the care is woven the love in glances and gratitude
Failing to see that, am I being good to blame the partner?
In life, shine alone do not lighten the path
For darkness always make the shine brighter
And every path ends at the opposites
No matter which direction I may choose to wander.
Sins and moral conscience bears no effect on deluded mind
Until in a corner I sit to repent of actions I intent to take
To forsake my partner, or to embrace my partner?
Life shall tell the rest of the story
In this mystery that we live
Do we have to rewrite our own history?
So, we may make another life story?
Would I travel alone into the dark room
Of a future not dictated by my mind
Assuming my infatuated love is true
Without the torch to brighten my path?
Others may appear good, gentle and caring
But to what extend they are raring
To show me how high they can get me soaring?
I know my wife hardly shows the care
But why must I be bothered as long as I care
Let me handle this relationship with utmost care
One fragile move, my wife, I know will still care
But will my girlfriend, will fully care
Even for a little tear?
Though my senses, fail me, in sensing her care
I know time have kept us together
To stitch a book of wise journey
So an example my wife and I shall set.
So long my girlfriend…..
I don’t care whether you care
Down deep I still feel my wife does care
Within her heart I know, she only let me stay.
(Dedicated to all who lives in this confusion)
