FEAR NOT
Fear not the failure that comes before success.
Fear not the criticisms that test your character.
Fear not, the old age that comes with wisdom, knowledge and understanding.
Fear not poverty that can be eliminated with wealth.
Fear not hatred that will be conquered by love.
Fear not sickness that can be healed to good health.
Fear not death that will be wiped away by the Saviour above.
Fear not; swear not because God has your back.
