THE ANGER
The anger I have for you
What you say
What you do
You blame it all on me
You say things to make me angry
The anger you make me feel inside
It make me go crazy
Makes me want to fight
Makes me want to cry
What you do to make me angry
How you do things and how you act
How you think you always right
The anger that makes me hate
The things you do that makes me hate
Things you say that makes me hate
You think you always right that makes me hate
The anger that makes me keep hating
