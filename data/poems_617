FIRE AND WATER
Wild Mountains
Cool Breeze
Wild Woman
Your Fire Powerful
My Waters just as strong
Will your Fire put out my waters
Will my Waters douse your flame
The challenge is yours to accept
Fire and Water
Two Passions...Powerful
when married as a force
Are you the one I am to explore
of the least of these?
The one who will understand my passions
and my actions.
Wild Woman
Firey Woman
Let me douse your flame
Engulf yourself in my waters
Engulf yourself in my waters
Peter LeBuhn
