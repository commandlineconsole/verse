THIS PEN
The only reason I'm
writing now
Is because I love
this pen
It's such a pleasure
to use
No matter where
or when
But it's better on
good paper
Like the pages
in this book
Or settling for what
I can get
Be it by hook
or by crook
The only reason I'm
writing now
Is because I love
this pen
It's such a pleasure
to use
That I'm going to
