THERE'S ONLY SLEEP
As far as I'm concerned
The day is over
We've eaten, we've showered
There is nothing to say
As far as I'm concerned
We can drink or we can sleep
There is nothing else
That either of us can say
Oh, I just climb into the bed
You're still watching TV
It's not even ten
But I'm not even drinking
So what else is there
For us to be doing
There's nothing to say
There's no love to share
There's no sex in you
There's no hope in me
There's no beer in the fridge
There's nothing to say
There's only sleep
As far as I'm concerned
Until I can bare to break this
The day is over, once
We've eaten, we've showered
And there is nothing you can say
There is nothing either of us can say
There's only sleep...
