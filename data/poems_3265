TIME O' CLOCK
Takes your life upbeat like rollercoastar rides
Makes your life offbeat like waves and tides
Time gives you seasons of cheers and joyfulness
Time gives you reasons for tears and sorrowfulness
You see darkness around; time shows you the ray of hope
You see yourself break down; time helps you to cope
Brightest of days you will see; the darkest of nights you will witness
With time you will swallow failures and you will taste success
Time teaches you the principles and philosophies of life
Time teaches you to play with a toy as well as a knife
Time eases all the things and lets all the wounds heal
With time things conceal themselves, with time things reveal
As you will grow, time will unfold the colors of relations
As time will grow, you will unfurl your own perceptions
For everything that has to happen, time is pre set
Things ensue only at the set time, neither early nor late
To perceive the time game, arm poise and patience
To embark upon the mighty time, attest insistence
Time is what we all want the most
Time is what we all tend to use the worst
Time is the most incalculable thing that can ever be spent
If you lose time, you will be left, only to repent
Punctuality is the bandit of time whether pain or gain
Strike at the right time coz lost time is never found again
