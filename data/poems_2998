ONE TINY SORROW
At the moment of ending
Every lovely meet
One tiny sorrow in my heart
I couldn't kiss that dimple on your cheek
Why every night so beautiful
When the stars twinkle so bright
One tiny sorrow in my heart
Right now, I can't hug you tight
Oh forget these limits
These walls and fences
I feel forgetting this sorrow
And loving you with all my senses
But realizing all the problems
Things we cannot avoid
One tiny sorrow in my heart
Because of which I just cried
I should have been there
As you were always by my side
One tiny sorrow in my heart
Acceptingâ€¦ I wasn't right
I wanna broom away every worry
And bring back the sunshine
One tiny sorrow in the bachelor's heart
Which is asking, â€œWill you be mine? â€
