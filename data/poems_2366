BURNING! !
Some thing is burning,
which is leading me to a
world full of hatred and disgust.
why i have suddenly started
obeying my selfish mind
why it left my loving
heart some were deep beneath
the ferocious flames of my
'anger'
Why suddenly my broken heart
starts to fight for its anger
what's the thing which is
burning in me so badly
and at the end,
when the flames of my anger
burnt my life into ashes
then my soul reminds me
that it was my own
heart which was burning so
'badly'
