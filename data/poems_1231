O HOLY TREE
Christmas tree, dear christmas tree,
To the world you bring delight
Shining so clearly
We love you sincerely...
Santa will dress you tonight.
Tinsel of silver and gold will caress you
Making the dark winter season bright
Love ever glowing
And happiness flowing
Stay beside us until twelfth night.
Our room would be dull without you
There would be no magic sight
No presents beguiling
No pretty eyes smiling
No glittering yuletide of delight.
