EMOTIONS
As I wander aimlessly through the tall, green grass
I feel it's softness beneath my feet
Yet I feel its roughness running through my fingers and I glide them through
Hearing the wind rustle it, trying to get my attention
As I walk, I wonder
Would you stand by me through thick and thin?
Or do I have to walk this alone.
Emotions
They run amuck through me
But the one that stands out the most is...
Fear
Fear of being isolated, pushed out and even beaten down
Fear runs through me like a wild fire in the bush
I want to stop it myself
But somehow, deep down, I know I cannot do this alone
I need help you see
Will you be the one to reach out to save me?
Fear
Why do we have it?
Do we really need it in this world?
I wish I could stop all the fear that smothers people
People who are alone and need someone to comfort them
People who wished they knew what to do next,
People who fear death
People who fear life
I don't fear either of these things
I just fear myself
I walk alone on a beach that stretches for miles on end
So distant and far that the eye cannot see the end
I feel the sand spread beneath my feet and each grain caress the skin inbetween my toes
The sea water cools down my body heat as it laps against my feet
I stare out into the ocean blue
Hoping my fears will just wash away
With the tide that takes
Everything else
I feel the sea breeze brush through my hair
I close my eyes and breathe deeply
Smelling the salty air and letting it free my lungs of fumes from the city
I'm a country girl
Not from the city sticks
I'm free out here from fear
Why can't that be all the time?
I don't fear loneliness out here
I'm not afraid
