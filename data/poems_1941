REACH OUT
You’d be surprised
When you’re feeling alone in the Dark
That if you reach out your hand
How many there are around you
Within the dark themselves
So are we ever truly alone
Reach out your hand today
You’d be surprised
At just how many people
Will take it and hold it
When admitting you’re fragile
Not everyone is out to break you
