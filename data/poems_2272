ANGER
Anger when you get upset at something
you feel like you should blame it on someone,
Feel like you should put all of my anger on to someone else.
The feeling anger is not a good emotion.
Sometimes you think you want to hit something and yell at someone,
Anger is something that you can control,
Or try not to have that emotion to get out of control.
