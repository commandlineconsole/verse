***BREAK ME, MY PLEASURE
desires are made to be created
and so i was made the one that will unfold
the pleasures of your heart
now i want you to take your time
i allow you to break me the way you wanted
i allow you to crush me in your hands
who has never tasted the blood of true serenity
i won't beg for mercy, i know it will help you
my lover, my real soul, my desire
i will still make you beautiful
here in my heart no matter
how much you will break me
through the rush of your hands
it's always my pleasure.
