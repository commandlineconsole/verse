PERHAPS THAT'S WHY
This should not come as a surprise,
Since I wear no disguises...
Play charades or masquerade.
I am not trying to impress you.
Fully clothed or undressed.
I look for challenges...
To keep my best tested.
This should not come as a surprise,
Since I do nothing to attract attention.
What I am and do in someone's eyes...
That's for them and not for me to mention.
I wouldn't know how to relate,
To anyone like that!
Perhaps that's why I do what I do.
And not take crap I wont dish right back!
