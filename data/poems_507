I BROKE YOUR HEART BUT YOU BROKE MINE
My eyes gazed into yours,
and your eyes gazed into mine.
I was anonymous to you,
and you were anonymous to me.
I became one of your friends,
and you became one of mine.
Friends led to a feeling in my heart,
and a feeling in your heart.
I felt so much passion for you,
and you felt so much passion for me.
My passion was a fling,
but your passion was serious.
I broke your heart,
but you didn’t break mine.
I made you cry,
but you didn’t make me cry.
My feelings bloomed again,
but your feelings faded.
I love you,
but you don’t love me.
I broke your heart,
but you broke mine.
