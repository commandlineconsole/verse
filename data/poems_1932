AN ACT OF KINDNESS
He  noticed her expanding v
and wondered whether it would be
considered one man's sacrilege
or woman's greatest privilege.
No answer was inside his mind

Thus to escape he took his mast
and, with great pleasure ventured past.
Surprise, surprise showed in his eyes.
The promise that he fertilise
by means of his own stalagtite
bestowed new meaning to the night.
