THE UNOPENED BOX
I was browsing on e-Bay’s job lots
When I found an interesting thing
It said “This unopened box
could contain all manner of bling”
“Nobody knows just what is inside
The key’s rusted into the lock
Whoever buys this may have a surprise
May have a nice pleasant shock”
I bought the box and just couldn’t wait
To have a good look inside
I broke the lock on that old wooden crate
And had the strangest surprise
A white wedding dress and a beautiful fan
They looked to be quite unworn
Some sad sweet love letters sent from a man
Strangely,  most of the letters were torn
Then two golden rings in a satin lined box
Told me all that I needed to know
I then closed the lid and replaced the old lock
And buried the box in the snow
