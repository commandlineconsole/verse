FEAR TO LOVE
There is cold silence
between man and woman
silence that severs
the marrow of their own bones.
There is disgust
and anger between man and woman
disgust and anger
that cripple their passionÂ¨
to celebrate the presence
of each other.
There is fear in cold silence
There is fear in disgust and anger
the deathly fear of being rejected,
the fear to love
the fear of losing the other.
