SONNET # 92
Oh, heaven of delights, here comes my love
Looking so  beautiful, what lovely look!
Her pretty eyes so peaceful like the dove,
And then her face reads grace as if a book.
Oh, heaven of delights, here comes my dear;
That everything she does amaze my eyes.
She has the most delicious female rear,
And breasts so good my heart so glorifies.
Oh, heaven of delights, here come my sweet.
That nothing in this world compares with her.
Flowers and birds in beauty not compete;
Besides my love`s fair soul they are a bur
Oh, heaven of delights, here comes my all,
And I all mirth her pretty name do call.
