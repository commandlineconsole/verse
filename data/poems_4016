I MAY NOT CRY, I MAY NOT CARE ♥
I may not cry,
I may not care,
I may be alone,
But I don’t care.
Your not here,
So I don't care,
I will not cry,
I will not care.
Your not like me,
You can cry,
And you can care.
But I like it when your here,
Because I'm not alone,
And i'm not depressed.
So we wonder,
Are we the same?
No we’re not because,
I can’t cry,
I can’t care.
