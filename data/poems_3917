READY TO KILL
There's no salvage
In my cries
There's no compassion
In my lies
For life
There's no will
Don't care about life
I'm ready to kill
Redemption's lost
In my eyes
I drown in misery
'Till my soul dies
For mercy
There's no will
I don't care about life
I'm ready to kill
Sinister demons
Inside my mind
The path to hell
I have found
To spare lives
There's no will
Don't care about heaven
I'm ready to kill
All those people
Don't deserve to live
To make them bleed all
Would it be a sin
Hate in my eyes
For blood there's will
Don't care about heaven
I've got a need to kill
