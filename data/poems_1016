IT CAME TO PASS
All day we stayed gushing tears
but little came, which we managed to bear
but we were still in fear
cause like th first, the second might disapear
Not so long my prediction arrived.
This time breathing was to be considerd before surviving,
then i knew the pranks of joy and life
Joy i should blame for never stagnant but locomotive like fashion
thus from manshion to manshion.
here and there are pened heart for its accumulation
for the escape of ineluctable tribulation.
From my, i knew must face joy's tradition
