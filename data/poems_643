ON POETS
in our words we conjure images
memories
hopes and fears
we cause passions to spark
to burn within the souls of our readers.
we do not walk softly
but stomp and cry out
our voices not timid and shy
like inexperienced schoolgirls
but raucous and sure
flashing a lascivious smirk as we pass
our stories
told in meter and rhyme
of our own choosing
are meant to incite passions
to arouse
some like a gentle caress
others
joined with wanton shrieking and thrashing
tangled in the sheets
I am a courtesan
my voice
like my body
used and abused for the pleasure of others
a strumpet
exhibiting herself to anyone
everyone
