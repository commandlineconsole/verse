DANGER ZONE
This place i once called home
now a danger zone
dont get any closer or death will make you a new number.
i tried to warn you but you came inside
now your looking for the meaning not just the rhyme.
this is crazy, a new whirlwind of exposure.
driving past my house only in wonder.
surprise surprise your tragicomedy has arrived
you try to redeem yourself but they see our well thought out lies.
now im here and your there its how it will stay until i leave.
until i leave this place that once was a home, now just my danger zone
i throw things out the window, its my time to fly.
im not a....
i cry in pain but i look like im running a muck. make up a mess i fall up the stairs.
screaming and crying i leave this house.
im 15 again hiding in my closet....hoping they dont find me...
