MY  LOVE
My life was filled with fear
I lost my pride for years
I thought I’ll end in tears
But you brought me joy and cheers
Tis how my heart grazes
In the greenness of your tresses
It’s no exultation or praise
I enjoy the warmth of your embrace
Your love has brought me joy
Your beauty has stripped me off
I aggrandize in your loving world
I love, I cherish you, my wreath of joy.
