FEAR IS ALWAYS THERE
Some people say they fear nothing,
I say so myself.
But that is wrong,
that cannot be true.
When people say they fear nothing,
it makes me think.
Fear is always there,
as a part of our lives.
I say I fear nothing,
I say I can handle all,
But that is wrong,
I know that is not true.
Of course, we all fear death,
I fear death,
But that is not my worst fear.
I fear I lose all,
I fear I lose my friends,
I fear I lose my family.
Even though I don't say so.
Even though I may not show it.
I fear I lose all I love.
Some people say they fear nothing,
But that is not true.
They fear something,
we all do.
Just because of the fact,
that fear is always there,
as a part of our lives
