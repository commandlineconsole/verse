FEAR OF DEATH
Everybody fears death unless they have made peace with themselves
Most people haven't though when they die
People mostly will fear on the how they will die
Will they die slowly and painfully, or will they die quick and painless
Or will they have enough time to talk to the ones they loved before it's too late
Some people fear being murdered and stabbed or shot by someone
Although most people fear of dying from a disease cancer
Cancer can be the worst to die from because it's slow and if you beat it
It can come back and get you the second time
So we should always fear death
Because you don't know when it's your time.
