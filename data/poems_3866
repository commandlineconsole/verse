BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
You can't stop me from calling
to ask you if you're alright
because I care.
You can't stop me from coming
to see if you're fine
because I care.
You can't stop me from telling you
that you are wrong when you are wrong
because I care.
You can't stop me from caring
every day every night
because I love you.
