ANGRY
I was angry with a friend
I took my wrath and my wrath did end
I was angry with a foe
I took my wrath and my wrath did grow
I found anger in my fears,
and tried to hide them in my tears
I found anger in the night
I took my wrath with much delight
I found anger in the day
I took my wrath but it just stayed
It hasn't changed in many years
threw the anger heart ache and tears
I tell you this for all to know
no matter the wrath that you show
Take delight in the sun
Take delight in the fun
Don't waste your life with an angry foe
Be happy for all and let it show
