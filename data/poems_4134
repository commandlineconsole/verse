LETTING GO
The rain when it fall, Helps wash away the tears, Which cleanses out the heart, And takes away your fears.
The fear of the unknown, The fear that holds you back, The fear that turns you around, The fear that knocks you off track.
The things that keep you from being, The very best you can be, The fear that keeps you from conquering, The obstacles in front of thee.
How could you ever know, If your life is led by fear, So breaks the chains that bind you, Before that chance should disappear.
