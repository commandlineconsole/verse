HE’S HERE
God’s here there and everywhere
In air on sea and land
Even with me in times prayer
With coffee cup in hand
He’s not concerned of how we’re sat
He knows our heart and mind
But if there’s welcome on our mat
For neighbours lost and blind
He sees each humble soul that burns
Each burdened heart full tears
Anxieties, our grave concerns
All worldly doubts and fears
God’s mighty arm is swift and sure
He’s holy through and through
Through prayer we get to know Him more
And what we ought to do
He likes to hear the good we’ve done
The bad we would repent
He wants to hear of Christ His Son
If time with Him we’ve spent
He loves to hear our songs of love
Our laughter loud and free
Speaking in truth through Jesus’ Dove
Where no one else can see
Nothing’s wasted nothing goes by
Nothing goes out of date
God gives answers to how and why
To those prepared to wait
He’s here today! He’s there right now!
He loves us all so much
Speak to your God, stand, kneel or bow
He’s never out of touch
