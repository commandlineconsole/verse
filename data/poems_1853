CONTINUALLY OUR LOVE SURPRISES ME
Continually our love does me surprise,
as sometimes you bring me pain
and sometimes you hold on to me
while sometimes it feels as if I am reaching into a whirlpool
but sometimes you take away everything bad.
Continually our love does me surprise,
and sometimes tears run over your cheeks
but sometimes it's as if the sun shines through your eyes
and sometimes you hold on to me
while our love is much stronger than just a maybe,
and I am smitten by the look on your face.
Continually our love does me surprise,
as if new depths continually comes to it,
you become part of my awareness
and sometimes you hold on to me
and it's as if we perfectly fit into each other's lives
while continually you are part of me, of my existence;
continually our love does me surprise,
and sometimes you hold on to me.
