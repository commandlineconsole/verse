LOVE IS PRIME ON EARTH AND IN HEAVEN
Love rules all things though man may disagree
Love’s key opens man’s problematic locks
Love is the cause for Maker making man
Love is the reason why God takes him too!
Love is the winner clear over hatred
Love gives a deeper meaning to our lives
Love makes the brotherhood of nations true
Love goads man’s heart to seek the creator
Love is the basis for man’s existence
Love turns each home, a living paradise
Love makes a man akin to God at times
Love brings us forgiveness of God and bliss
Love turns the earthly transience worth living
Love gives an aim divine in our journey
Love helps us face our challenges in life
Love makes all human beings more humane
Love keeps the human race to grow stronger
Love moves all hearts to remorse, repentance
Love made the one God sacrifice His Son
Love is the cause of heaven’s reality
Love fills the empty heart with hope anew
Love opens new windows and vistas
Love fuses souls to Maker’s intentions
Love adds dignity to our earthly stay
Love is the most potent weapon on earth
Love is the lasting solution to peace
Love makes the earth a somewhat paradise
Love is a gift more precious than all wealth!
