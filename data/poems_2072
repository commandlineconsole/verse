LIES
I know man lies; for sure I know woman lies
So what is this saying of mankind? To me this isn't a surprise
To make a good liar you must sell the fib while everyone else buy
But like a drug dealer you can't get high on your on supply
The worst thing you as a liar can do is start believing her only Lies
You thought you were playing me but you got the surprise
Your game wasn't tight you have nothing to show for what you did
Yeah I was hurt I even cried I went searching for a wife & over bid
I know man lies; for sure I know woman lies
So what is this saying about mankind? To me this wasn't a surprise
