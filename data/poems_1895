IT IS I
“IT IS I”
Surprise, surprise, guess Who’s here
You are never going to believe
If I hadn’t seen Him with my very own eyes
I would have been deceived
There they were, the nail printed hands
The feet and wounded side
When He broke bread and ate the fish
My heart melted and stirred inside
Lord, Lord is that You I cried
He answered, “Peace, be of good cheer.”
“It is I, I have arisen
It ‘tis God that you see here.
Haven’t I told you, if you’ve seen me
You’ve also seen the Father
Now go and tell, tell the others
Tell your son’s and daughters
Jesus Christ is alive and
From the grave has risen
No longer can they, walk in darkness,
I have given them vision
