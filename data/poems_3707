NOBODY
Nobody knows me
Nobody cares
Nobody knows me
Nobody cares
This isn't how I thought my life would be
It was supposed to be just you and me
But now you're gone
I'm on my own
Battered and bruised
All confused
Nobody knows me
Nobody cares
Nobody knows me
Nobody cares
What did I do so wrong for you to be
So evil, so cruel always to me
How can I move on
From what you've done
This is your legacy
Nobody knows me
Nobody cares
Nobody knows me
Nobody cares
Was it that you never cared
Even after all we've shared
All my hopes and my dreams
Were just a part of your scheme
Now that I'm on my own
There's so much that you'll never know
