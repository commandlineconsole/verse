EVERYBODY WANTS TO
Everybody wants to
Be loved and show love
Everybody wishes to
Be cared and show care
For God has given
All of us a heart
From where always
Feelings impart
A very special feeling
That is known as zeal
That clings to you
With a desire to feel
Special and cared
And wanted too
And that is what is
Called love 'n care true.
