I'LL LOVE YOU EVEN IF YOU DONT!
I love the flowers
I love the trees
I love the rivers
I love the bees.
I love oranges
I love dew
I love seasons
I love hues
I love them all
But they dont love me,
But i'll continue loving 'em
As long as i be
The same way i do
Deeply love you
Its not needed you love me
As much as i do
I'll keep loving you
Though you'll love me never
Just like the seasons
N flowers, forever
