SOME TREASURE
Deepth of my feelings
Are hard to measure
For your presence has brought
Me so much pleasure
That everywhere now
I see the flowers
Spread on the path
To show love's power
I feel very lucky
And very glad
To have you for friend
When things are bad
For your presence has brought
Me so much pleasure
That I feel as if
I have found some treasure.
