ORANGE DELIGHT
Today my soul chose orange
through my open window,
where Bauhinia galpinii blossoms
were warm-laughing their dancing beauty
on a cool green background d√©cor
and the flood of colour smiled me to delight
as monkeys bounded from tree to tree
in the foreground;
and later, on the road,
sister trees in other gardens
and fringing the local nature reserve
as though today is the day of
Bauhinia galpinii
and then on the freeway,
as if to smile me further,
Spathodia campanulata bells
trilled their happy East African songs
a day of orange delight
as bright as the glorious
blazing summer sun
in a sky of pristine blue.
