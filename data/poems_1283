SHELTER
I seek the shelter of your smile
from attacks of wild beasts,
this is why I offer to you all
the love and faith of my heart.
Do not think because I am afraid
I choose to delight at your side.
Because I am a naked heart
I come to bask in your love
against the freezing world.
I come to delight in life
in the shelter of your smile.
