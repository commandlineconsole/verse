LOVE
Love to me my Kingdom is
Love to me is what love does
Love to me is conquering one self
Love is but today what tomorrow will be
Love can be a story untold
Love can be a heart of pure gold
Love can be a simple good deed
Love can be today what yesterday was
Love is passion be stored
Love is doubtless and bold
Love is communication I'm told
Love is now what today maybe.
Love will stand when others fail
Love will win no matter what prevails
Love will conquer great and small
Love will be our today's yesterday
Tomorrow's and our forevers.
