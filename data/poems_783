A TINY WORD
Good words are like a string of pearls
That carries joy in all the curles
And bring to others to happiness door
Marked with joy, care, fun and more
So try to say nice things to all
Even if its a tiny word or small
For joy that will be left behind
Will surely spread happiness all kind
So put nice words together my dear
As it also shows how you care
And seek for hidden joy in curles
For good words are like a string of pearls.
