IS IT WRONG TO FEAR?
I like to sleep quietly and calmly,
In the comfort of darkness,
The thought erupts as volcano,
With fiery fire and intense sound,
The fear of the future stands stagnant,
The scenes are different, but the fear is the same
The fear of animals with teeth and kidnappers,
who enter through the back door to grab my feet,
the fear of monthly quarterly, half yearly and annual,
Mark sheets that require parent's signature,
The fear of losing a friend over a lollypop,
The fear of our secrets to be spread as wild fire,
The fear of the opposites, who try to play,
The top on the smooth skin of our young stomach,
Sometimes they let the butterflies to stand and flutter,
The fear of future with good degree and a good spouse,
The fear of spouse strays on the streets of foreign land,
The arrival of children, their petty sickness and education,
their marriage, their spouses and their issues,
The arrival of grand children and their glory and glamor,
The arrival of great grand children and their pranks,
I want to sleep quietly and calmly,
In the comfort of darkness on my bed,
Where I have never slept without worrying of future,
As the future is the constant confusion that torture,
Though I have repeated thousand to one,
Backwards, the score of prayers forward,
Repeating the names and glory of God many fold,
The fear of future just sticks with me as my soul.
