HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT
He loves me,
he loves me not
Like a fairy tale
a flower pedal
represents love,
but of course
He loves me,
he loves me not
There is no
I'm not sure's
or I like you, but's
just seven little words
He loves me,
He loves me not
There are no other girls
no jelousy or pain
no arguments, no humiliation
it all falls into
He loves me,
He loves me not
But what if...
it doesn't exist
if love is truly such a fairy tale
then explain this:
He loves me,
He loves me not
He loves me,
He loves me not
He loves me,
He loves me not
