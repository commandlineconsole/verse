PAIN AND PASSION
Velvet and black lace
These tears of harsh regret
Roses that drip blood
Tell stories i can't forget
Absent from my reality
Terror in my eyes
Nothing stops it happening
No love here? No surprise
Violent storms of rage
As i scream and fight my way
Raindrops that fall softly
Will hear what i've got to say
Heavy head with a deep heart
Easier said than done
Never had it easy
Since my life begun
But the result of my pain is my passion
It's the reason i get through each night
And through it all it's my passion
The drive that continues my fight
