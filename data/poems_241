I LOVE IT
I love it when you kiss my lips
i love it when you hug my hips
i love it when you take me there
i love it when you pull my hair
i love it when we go together
i love it in the rainy weather
i love it when its sunny outside
i love it when you let me ride
i love it how our bodies touch
i love when we love so much
i love it when we laugh and play
i love it when your off today
i love it i feel your heart
i hate it when we are apart
i love it when you come right back
i love hat our love is a fact
i love that your so smart and sweet
i love it when our eyes meet
i love it cuz we take it father
when we love, we love, harder and harder.
i love it when you look at me
cuz i love you and you love me
