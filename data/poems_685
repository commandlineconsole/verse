THOUGHT OR ROMANCE
Mama's world is different than papa's
Hers is romance
His is thought;
Thought and romance
Which do I prefer?
I prefer mama's world,
Tears
Joy
Passion
Love;
A kaleidoscope of hearts,
A diversity of human expression;
Children play
Adults kiss
Old men stroke the beard gently;
Even the sun
Is not harsh,
Casting as it does
Warm glistening showers and
Not the harsh passion of
Dreary
Pondering.
