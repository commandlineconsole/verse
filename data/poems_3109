ELEMENT OF COALESCE
One has distress
Another’s got a hopeless longing
There exists such sorrow
Our precious treasured element
“Affection”
Life would be so valuable
To know that every personal you’d pass by
Is embracing you in their heart
Alluring you with a warm smile day after day
One has distress
Another’s got a hopeless longing
There exists such sorrow
Our precious treasured element
“Connection”
If you were to come across a girl in deep sorrow,
What would you do?
If you have distress, what can you do?
Would being there for her be enough to divulge the light?
For the first time, I feel like I didn’t say enough
Don’t stop breathing, this is only the beginning
I can’t keep swimming in this bitter world, knowing that you’re alone
I hate what the world’s done to you,  to I, to us
One has distress
Another’s got a hopeless longing
There exists such sorrow
Our precious treasured element
“Love”
Look closely on the floor,  you’ll  see with your own eyes
The path that we took all those years to get here has already disintegrated
