when the light of heaven is light
it's the world of two thousand seven bright
sown for you blackberry's delight

it must be octaves from lord krishnas flute

a boy to a girl with the happys of heaven
sown for you blackberry's delight
on the first of seven's night
sown for you blackberry's delight

go to the  fields and harvest your share
my blackberrys ripen with the dawn of the sun
hares and birds may already be having there fun
sown for you blackberry's delight
on the first of seven's night
sown for you blackberry's delight
on the first of seven's night
