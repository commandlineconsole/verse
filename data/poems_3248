TOMORROW'S SORROWS
Look around
See what you found
Tears follow
Tomorrow's sorrow
Take a look
Read a book
Your eyes can see
The coming misery
Look at the sky
Wonder why
Hell fire and brimstone
It passes by
Look down the street
You will see
No children running
None will be
It is told
From long ago
Having his feast
The day of the beast
Stop now
Son of a gun
Hope to die
Wont be done
You can run
Try to hide your soul
He will find you
Where ever you go
Stop now
See what youâ€™ve done
To late to hide
Soul on the run
Look around
See what you found
Tears follow
Tomorrow's sorrows.
