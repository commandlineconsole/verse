JOYFULNESS
These Great joys in life
Will keep me Going
No one can take them away.
When joy is there in every mind
Joy is everywhere you find
Joy is there in every stage,
Happiness, Anger, kindness & rage
This joy that never asked for a price,
This joy that fills my soul,
This joy that sets me free from all my worries,
This joy that I can't explain
Sets me free inside
