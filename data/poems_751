TEARS OF JOY!
Tears of Joy!
Tears of joy I will cry for you, let my love flow eyes for all to see!
Tears of joy I will be your happiness, I will be there to erase them for you!
Tears of joy, I will be for you, through good and bad times we share!
Tears of joy I will be your shining light forever you're my burning desire!
Tears of joy I will kiss my beautiful angels face, never to let go!
Tears of joy I will hold your hand, and we will make a solid stand!
Tears of joy I will walk beside you never to be alone my dear!
