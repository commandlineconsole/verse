SHE IS MY LIFE I AM HER SHADOW
I never mind
How many times
You break my dreams
As I have in my hand
The delight to know
the unknown which
tells me to live
more  and more
and teaches me how to live
how  to find’’ hope’’ in despair
to me life is like a shadow
love to follow it everywhere
as it reflects only  me
my only own
sometimes foe  sometimes  friend
sometimes known sometimes unknown
frequently gives wonder and surprise
that’s the life
it  attracts me more
gives more  delight
and it is my life,
I love to follow it like a shadow
