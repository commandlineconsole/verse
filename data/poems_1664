ESCAPE FROM NIGHTMARE
I want to give
My sorrows, some words
My words, some meanings
My meanings, some comfort
My comfort, some pleasures
My pleasures, some smiles
My smiles, some colours
My colours, some hues
And
My hues an escape-
An escape
From this terrifying nightmare
Known as life..............
