CRY ME A RIVER
Cry me a river
It ain't no pleasure
Your tears are deceiving
It seems you are leaving me behind
Cry me a river
It's such a pleasure
I know you are grieving
It seems I am leaving you behind
You cry you cry you cry
And you don't know how to stop
You cry me an ocean, full and deep
And I try to help you before you drop
You already know the answer
To the question never asked
And all I want is for you
To show me your heart unmasked
