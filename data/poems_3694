IN CARING SHE CARES NOT
In caring for my cryptic and prudent promises;
in caring for a legion of long and keen chords;
in caring she houses them in her bosom; the grotesque groans;
in caring she fathoms a  phantom, her darling destiny;
in caring i err on an errand once and think twice;
in caring she must be of a  misty wit, and the poet's peril,
