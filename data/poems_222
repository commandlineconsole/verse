EVOL
Love is for the lovely
Lovely can't be loveless
This world is a hot mess
Love is for the lovely
We're caught up in sex and flesh
Love is for the lovely
Love isn't for the loveless
Love is no longer from the heart
Love is from the eyes
Love is no longer spiritual
Love has become carnal
Love is no longer love
God has been removed from love
Love has become worthless
Love is no longer timely
Love has become sporadic
Spontaneity isn't love
Love has become spontaneous
