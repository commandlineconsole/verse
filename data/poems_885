TEARS OF JOY
Not all tears are caused by suffering and pain
Some are caused by blessings from above.
Tears of joy let others witness firsthand
How we flourish from God’s purpose and love.
Tears of joy are God’s wisdom to man
That all things good come through Him alone.
When blessings take place which transform our lives
We cry in gratitude as thankfulness is shown.
Tears of joy are Devine wealth from Heaven
Which reward all who submit to God’s will.
Tears of joy fortify our faith and trust
As we serve, disciple, honor, glorify and fulfill.
