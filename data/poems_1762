SIMPLE PLEASURES
Life is full of simple pleasures
We don’t always realize
But life shows us many things
Opportunities constantly arise
The trees along the roadways
Beautiful rock that we see too
A horse inside a gated fence
Wild flowers of every hue
A lake with life’s reflections
With magnificent trees around
We capture so many wonderful things
Through sight and also sound
Look out into a barnyard
Cattle with their soulful eyes
Charming cats of every color
Underneath the azure skies
Yes, life’s full of simple pleasures
They make me want to smile
So many blissful moments
If you stop and look awhile!
