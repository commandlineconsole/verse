THE DISTILLABLE EGO
**
The distillable ego taught me
A thing or two
Concerning the easily obtained virtues
One comes across
Through lamentation
And dilemma
He told me not to fear it
When it comes
I easily reached a high peak
And descended effortlessly
Though rapidly through space
As I fell
When I felt conscious
Of my virtues
I left him
My ego called me
Distraught
And told me a thing or two
I did not know before
Come to me again I said
Tell me more
This is very interesting
What I did not know before
Come and tell me some more
I do not know
I want to learn
I felt unmoving
I let it penetrate my surface
I felt it sink in
It sapped my energy
My highly exposed emotions
Left something behind
Something of me
I do not know what it is
I wish you would tell me what it was
