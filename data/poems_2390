IF I COULD
If I could
I would
But I can't
So I will shut my mouth
And bite my tounge
I will smile
I will laugh
I won't show you my anger
The anger I have
Towards you
Please beware
I can only take this so long
Before I burst
So I will open my mouth
And allow my voice to scream
I will hate
I will kill
My anger will come out
Maybe a little to extreme
But I have to release it
To allow myself to feel better
I am looking down
Down at your grave
With a sad smile
I allowed myself to hate
Allowed myself to kill
I will cry
I will pray
I've commited a crime
Because of my anger
I feel better
I am not angry anymore
My mind may feel better
But my heart is in pain
I did something awful
So I will pray
And hope my sins are forgiven
I will hate again
I will kill again
My heart won
My mind lost
Now I'm dead
