I WANT TO LOVE
I
want to love with someone
who could understand me
I
want to share with my love all the desires of my life
I
want to live all the life in the lap of my love
I
want that my love always love with me
I
want that my love did not alone me anywhere
because love is the most precious gift of God
I
want to love with someone
who could sincere with me
