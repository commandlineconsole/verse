PARTING
They say parting is such sweet sorrow.
I say it is the death of tomorrow.
For all the tomorrows can only be
endless time for you and me.
And endless time is a chasm of space,
to hard to endure, too hard to face.
What can replace what was so sweet?
How can one ever feel complete?
You think and think and ask God why?
But no answers come as time goes by.
As the time passes there's another tomorrow
and that tomorrow is filled with sorrow.
The sorrow is filled with the missing part
that kept alive your racing heart.
Parting can never be sweet sorrow.
All it can be is a lonely tomorrow.
