JOY
You bring peace and serenity into my life.
Joy to my entire  existence. Joy is the light
That fills my heart with hope of the future,
Faith that we will be together forever.  Itâ€™s
Our love that makes each day special.
Joy is much more than happiness.  Joy is like
Sunshine that fills you with a warm, wonderful
Feeling that radiates to everyone around you.
It lights your way through life and fills your
Heart with so much love, it overflows to everyone
Around you.
Joy is being loved by you.
Joy is being kissed  and being held in your arms.
Joy is spending my life with you and bringing Joy into your life.
