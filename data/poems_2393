WISPER YOUR SECRETS
Whisper your secrets into my skin,
Come out clean, I'll hold your sin.
Whisper your secrets to my lone heart,
Before our sin's poison gets a head start.
Whisperï»¿ your secrets into my hair,
And each strand will hold a care.
Whisper your anger into my pale hands,
Hate in my fists only you you understand.
Whisper your anger in my fragile mind,
Let anger simmer over time.
Whisper your anger into my head,
And I'll repeat every word you said.
Whisper your love into my palms,
And you will feel my calm.
Whisper your love into my lips,
And we'll lose ourselves in ignorance bliss.
Whisper your love into my soul,
And I'll show you something beautiful.
Whisper your secrets into my ear,
And know not a soul will hear.
