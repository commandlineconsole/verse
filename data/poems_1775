ENLIGHTENED ONE
Sin dangles inaccessibly two feet away from oppression
Betwixt the two is a serpentine stream
Which carries the Constitution
By excluding sin there can be no pleasure
Without pleasure there can not be attributes of God
Oh God, speed up oppressions
Give it the magnet-zeal, enlightenment
Sin dangles inaccessibl two feet from oppression
Nothing exists in between
Any shame, any repentance
