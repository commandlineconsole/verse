THE PASSION FROM WITHIN
If you want something, you’ve got to believe you can have it, and take a stand;
Give it all you got, and reach out your hand;
You can’t just go through life without falling in fire;
In time, I think you’ll find what you truly desire;
Find your true passion, the passion from within;
If you can’t find your passion, then don’t stop until you do;
For only yourself can find the true you;
Just take a deeper look inside;
Life isn’t always going to be an easy ride;
You can’t always get what you desire, you have to fight;
You can find your way, because God is the light;
When your life gets rough, and you feel bad, just pray;
If you don’t understand, talk to God, He is the way;
When you find your passion, hold it, and don’t ever let it go;
You will have your days that the good in you will show;
Is it your turn to shine?
Come on, I think it’s time
My time has come, so let’s begin
For I have found the passion, The Passion from within
