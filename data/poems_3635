CATNAPPING
I close my eyes but I do not sleep.
I close my eyes to concentrate on thoughts I keep.
I might be fantasizing.
I might be rhyming.
My thoughts may concern calendar timing.
I may be considering options for future acceptance or declining.
I close my eyes but I do not snooze,
Because my mulling of thoughts, our rapport, I do not abuse.
