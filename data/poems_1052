^ IN THE GOLDEN MOMENTS
In the golden moments of life
Where we are all bound to survive
I wish to take care of you
And share all your fain's hue
I wish to colour your life's days
With plenty of joys and happiness bays
And hope to share and always gather
Warm and cozy life time together
Where joy and fresh days lie
And there is twinkle in every eye
And pet memories and wishful hopes
Are always ready to take away mopes
I love you SUNNY for you're my friend
With whom I don't need to pretend
Who showed me colours in life's days
And filled joys and happiness bays
And today is special so I want to send
A wish for Valentine's Day my friend
And hope in this highway of life
We'll spend every moment with joy's drive.
