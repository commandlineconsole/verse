FEAR IS LOVE
Hell is the face of the person you despise
And an expression of the race evolution crucified
Knowledge teaches us what morality calls shame
And who to persecute when we need to establish blame
Evil sleeps in the good, when they are tethered into the world
And awakens in the desperate when optimisms anorexic
All criminals are born in the same beds as your children
The only innocent are those bathed inside of Gods detention
Sleep is the peace that waken minds never find
Down half forgotten streams with no rudder to rewind
Being lost is experience learned from coldness of yearning
Youï¿½re stuck on the ocean with Red skyï¿½s for sailors mooring
Fear is love
And love is god
Fear your god who loves your tears
Now I spy a voice thatï¿½s living in my home
Sheï¿½s got the gaze of an infinite dark storm
I bury myself between the sheets of her dark lips
Hoping that tomorrow is somewhere between the hours next abyss
There's no faith I have accept the air I breathe
It chokes me with a clarity that contaminates my being
What you see is you, and the inventions of daily habits
Religion is an opiate that disciplines puritan addicts
Fear is love
And love is god
So Fear your god who loves your tears
Fear is love
And love is god
So Fear your god who loves your tears
Fear is love
And love is god
So Fear your god who loves your tears
