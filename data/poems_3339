BURNING SHAME
As the fire burns
You start to be concerned
Maybe they won't care
If we all burned
We lift the flame
So high
And scream shame
They live there lives
Singing about how much
They hate there wives
So I'll walk away in silence
As the fire burns
You start to be concerned
Maybe they won't care
If we all burned
We lift the flame
So high
And scream shame
