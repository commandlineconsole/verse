LIFE IN ITS MYSTERY
Life is a teacher
So much more we learn
History is its preacher
To be notice is why we yearn
Life is a pregnant mother
Her unborn son is death
Father would one day lose mother
The day death takes a breadth
Pleasure is the father
Sorrow is his son
You don't need to bother
One day life will be gone
Pleasure is faithful
Life is unfaithful
Life would accept death
Leaving pleasure on a sorrowful earth
