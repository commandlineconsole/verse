JOY'S FORT
Brush away tears
Oh my dear
And learn to share
Love and care
For life is adream
As soft as a cream
where survive's beam
Of joy's scream
But you have to
Learn the true
Art of joy's hue
To enjoy life's view
And learn to smile
All for a while
So in your trial
You can dial
The happiness code
To share the load
Of the tear's boat
To build joy's fort.
