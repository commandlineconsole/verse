SORROW
It is hard to live
It is hard to give
it is hard to here
Survive my dear
Because all tomorrows
Are filled with sorrows
And in life's hall
Trouble's wall
Is present to stop
And from there drop
More sorrows new
To make you blue
So you can taste
And once again waste
One more day
In your way
Fighting with sorrow
To see bright tomorrow.
