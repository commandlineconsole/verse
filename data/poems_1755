FORBIDDEN
Forbidden pleasures
Who makes the rules
Unfound treasures
And beautiful jewels
Can that line be crossed
What could we truly be
And at what cost
Do you see what I see
I know there is more there
Waiting to be found
Can you feel how much I care
I feel like I'm being drowned
If you knew the amount of desire
That I feel for you
My burning fire
That wants one to become two
Forbidden pleasures
Who makes the rules
Unfound treasures
And beautiful jewels
