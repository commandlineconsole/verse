WALLEYE FISHING SONG
Oh, show me that hole
where the Walleye extols
the wonders of Canada's north.
I'll fish there real soon
'til the light of the moon
and return with the freshest main course.
Ooooh, where is that hole?
It's been hours without even a bite.
With those big glassy eyes
and their lack of surprise,
Walleye's tasty with hardly a fight.
I'm in need of a beer
and a woman - I fear
these distractions will snag up my day.
Though I'm parched and in need
of missed pleasures indeed,
a Walleye is better I'd say.
Ooooh, where is that hole?
It's been hours without even a bite.
With those big glassy eyes
and their lack of surprise,
Walleye's tasty with hardly a fight.
But if no hook I set
on a Walleye, I'll get
a bare-breasted buddy I'd like,
but if she turns me down,
maybe she'll come around
when I promise her Great Northern Pike!
Ooooh, where is that hole?
It's been hours without even a bite.
With those big glassy eyes
and their lack of surprise,
Walleye's tasty with hardly a fight.
She insists on her jacket
Oh, why did I pack it?
She'd still look good if she drowned.
She thinks I'm not funny
when I've paid so much money
for this dry, empty net and her frown.
Ooooh, where is that hole?
It's been hours without even a bite.
With those big glassy eyes
and their lack of surprise,
Walleye's tasty with hardly a fight.
Oh, better her thighs
than her miserable sighs
when no Walleye, but Pike should arise.
She complains I'm a clod
with a second-rate rod
It's not her - it's me, in her eyes.
Ooooh, where is that hole?
It's been hours without even a bite.
With those big glassy eyes
and their lack of surprise,
Walleye's tasty with hardly a fight,
Soooooooo -
I tied her a pole,
and said, 'YOU find that hole! '
which she did - with ONE toss of the line!
Oooh! Bewildered by bliss
and that first Walleye kiss,
I knew that fine*Â woman was mine!
Ooooh, where is that hole?
It's been hours without even a bite.
With those big glassy eyes
and their lack of surprise,
Walleye's tasty with hardly a fight,
Woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oooo
Woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo o
Woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oooo
