WORRY
There was fire in her eyes
As she waited by the door.
She certainly had done this
Many times before.
She tapped her foot and counted
And watched the clock hands wind.
The longer that she did this
The longer she did find
That anger was invading
And making her uptight.
That is until she saw him again
Home within her sight.
Her anger now subsided.
He kissed her fears away.
Anger came from worry
That maybe on someday
The job he had that took him
To a dangerous place
Would finally make her anger
Stay upon her face.
