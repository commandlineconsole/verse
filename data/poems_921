THE LORD HAS WIPED MY TEARS
Though I lost all
Though my tears wet my clothes
He's with me
Though I lost a lot
And I feel weak
He says He's my strength
He makes me sing
He gave me joy
He wiped my tears
He stood with me
He comforted me
He made me smile
Through my bad and tryin times
He held me up
And He says..
It's because He loves me
And so i sing unto Him
Cos my heart is filled with joy
And now i shed
But only tears of joy
