KISS ME MY LOVE
Kiss me, kiss me my love
Kiss me and I will love you more,
Kiss me and I show you more,
Kiss me, kiss me my love,
Kiss me and I make love to you,
Kiss me and I will take you far
Kiss me, kiss me my love
Touch me, touch me my love,
Touch me and touch me alone,
Touch me  and I will take you along,
Touch me, touch me my love
Touch me and I wont run away,
Touch me and touch me there,
Touch me and I will go astray
Touch me, touch me my love
Hold me, hold me my love,
Hold me and I will make you mine,
Hold me and I fly with you,
Hold me, hold me my love
Hold me and I wont go anywhere,
Hold me and I will love you anyway,
Hold me, hold me my love
Love me and I make you my queen,
Love me and I will move with you in,
Love me and I will love you more,
Love me, love me my love,
Love me and I will make it sunny,
Love me and I will chase the clouds away,
Love me, love me my love
