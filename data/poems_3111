IT IS......
it is the sorrow
that connects well with
sorrow
one man's misery to another man's misery
makes us celebrate a
newly  found day another kind way
it is the bitter drink
that knows how bitter
is another person's
drink
not happiness since it
knows how to isolate itself
as a form of escape and
fought freedom
for it is in happiness that
one gets paired with
selfishness
that non-mindedness about
the plight of the
oppressed
a happy home separates you
from the rest of the sadness of this world
the comfortable light inside the living room
at night
always have a locked door and closed glass windows
as walls
evading what misfortune once was there
forgetting every trauma that was inflicted
upon the wounded hearts the scarred minds
the lost situation  of the soul
it is the deepest sorrow
that creates a hole where we all must fall
and finally find
the best home that understands
what sorrow is there that
others have long embedded
in their broken selves
it is the brokenness that knows
what mending is
it is the war that destroys mankind
that makes civilization understand more
what peace is all about
how important must it  become
it is this injustice that makes me
a silent water
that seeks the best level of my
existence
with the least possible
resistance there is
