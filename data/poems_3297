THERE IS A POEM OF OUTRAGE AND SORROW
THERE IS A POEM OF OUTRAGE AND SORROW
There is a poem of outrage and sorrow I cannot write in a strong enough way-
It concerns the injustice of allowing murderers to go free-
It concerns the additional hurt and pain given to families
Who have had their loved ones cruelly taken from them-
It concerns one person I knew and deeply cared for
Burned to death-
A kind quiet man
Whose murderer will now go free-
There is a poem of outrage and sorrow I cannot write in a strong enough way-
It concerns a country so concerned with saving one life
That they risk the lives of many to do this
A country too compassionate
And an enemy so evil it sings and celebrates the deaths of children-
There is a poem of outrage and sorrow I cannot write in a strong enough way-
