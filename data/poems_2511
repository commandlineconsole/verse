Fearlessness is anger
Just pent up anger
When you don't care which arrows you throw
And who gets hurt
Desperation is just needing
When your whole world is bleeding
You pour it on the defenceless ones
In times when their believing
I can't imagine being
The one that you arent seeing
If dependancy gets too much
Im much too used to feeling
Will you still be needing me
When your fears are so unknown
I hope so dear
Will you be here
Don't chill me to the bone
