IN PREPAREDNESS
I look back and assess
What is there to bring shine on face?
The year is about to end
With lot more to think and messages be sent
It is necessary to take stock of situation
The same trend must not be the object of continuation
If you are young, you need to evaluate
Judge properly and nicely relate
If you are elderly person
The last stage needs to be looked into with reasons
How can they make their tail age best in coming day?
The family should remain intact and not be drifted away
The coming year is certainly matter of concern
Everybody deals it with caution to avoid “u” turn
The life must flow as smoothly as possible
No one expects rough weather and trouble
The material losses can be made good
The wrath of nature too can be understood
The good relation can be maintained in neighborhood
But what about enough buffer stock of food?
The reality comes before eyes?
The human min works with full try
The next year must prove productive
So many steps are taken in advance to remain active
It is human psychology to prepare for worst
The concerns for family members come first
There is no control over natural tragedy
Yet we are always in preparedness and ready
