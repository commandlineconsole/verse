CARE
Human care others rare, so in sour,
animal's wear and tear also cared but rare,
who care nation? but many store more,
flowers remain care, plugged every where,
nurse won't curse patients, they been patience,
lovers rarely cry since not been care,
mother care child till they become where?
leaders share thoughts to crowd, cared because taught,
fields when not care, grains become never,
finally god care all, still worry been mankind.
