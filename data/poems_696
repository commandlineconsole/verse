JOY
Joy is there in every mind
Joy is everywhere you find
Joy is there in every stage
Happiness, fury, kindness & rage
Without Joy the world is colorless
Without Joy the mind is dream less
When Joy comes in the world, it shines
With rainbow-tinted colors of light.
You can feel Joy by sharing
You can feel Joy by giving
You can feel Joy by thinking wise
And doing things that are always nice.
So why don't we make Joy grow
By sharing, giving & loving
So why should we not make every face
Lightened with Joy glowing.
