DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED  (BY FALL)
Driving while intoxicated
Drunk with the smells and sights
Of  yellow Oak trees and red maple leaves
And golden harvest moon nights
Weaving my way through mind boggling colors
Each turn full of new delights
The reds and the purples of the maple surples
Bring inebriatation to new heights
This excess of pastels seen through my windshield
Makes me feel high as a kite
And in my rear-view mirror, more colors revealed
the frigging fall’s flashin’… of red and blue light
Scrawlin’ my name on a pink ticket pad
Crawlin’ into the backseat of a black and white
Busted from being intossicatated
And drivin’Under the infuluence… of Fall’s delight
