SALVATION
Consider it done?
All the worry anxiety stress
For nothing?
No way, don't piss me off
Time wasted
Months and months and years
All the hard work sweat pain
Love lost
Empty bottomless pit
Consider it done?
You must be kidding
The tears trembling head pounding
For everything
For life and pleasure and death and pleasure
For nothing?
Consider it done?
stop
STOP
And consider it done.
