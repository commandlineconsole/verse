ONE FOR ONE(FOR ONELIA)
And so
I become
an Eye-rich man
seeing things as you do
take two words &
one into
the other
so that “laugh” & lovely”
“laughly.”
You teaching
me how
words
behave
when they are on their own
unencumbered by a human tongue
and how
they love
to play
teaching me the speech
of wonder.

All I can say is:
Reader...read her!
