OUR NIGHT IN ALJIBA
We've traveled for so many miles
And I can read your reaction from your face
You stare all around, then your eyes return to me
You gently smile, and take me by the hand
We arrive walking into this town, this new place
As the night is coming soon
And in very little time that it appears
We find a room to stay for the night
This night in Aljiba
We walk through town
Enjoying our night in Aljiba
I can hear a faint ticking of a watch
And walking along to the many different sounds
So many things to be bought
So many things to be found
Many strange but wonderful surprises abound
In the night time in Aljiba
After this wonderful night
With surprises everywhere tonight
We head back to our room to sleep and bid goodnight
As we enter slumber
Tonight in the town of Aljiba
