A CAT WHO FEARED NOT
I once came upon a cat who feared not
This odd little beast lay in water and did walk across fire
I thought to myself what insanity be this?
A cat who doth fear not water nor fire.....
Surely his wits must be scrambled and fried
For any creature has fear of the ways he might die
Then another thought did enter my mind
As I pondered upon this cat who feared not
This odd little creature so utterly small
Yet facing great fear with not a shiver at all
What freedom this wondering creature must feel
What a glorious life to have no fear at all
To stare death in the face saying, No, you'll not have me this day'
To walk where others dare only to dream
Tis I think a far better thing to be free of ones fear
Than to cower and hide from the world
Which hath boastfully told you you're not worthy this day
