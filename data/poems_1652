A SIMPLE PLEASURE
The sun shines on you,
gentle beauty sparkling through,
eyes reflecting like diamonds,
heart reflecting of love,
your hair like gold dust
blowing gently in the air,
laughter deep from your soul
lifts you higher and higher.
I watch you in humbled splendor
as back and forth you go...
never thinking of stopping
or letting go,
a simple pleasure that gives us joy,
back and forth a thousand times,
legs kicking in unison with each pass,
a day of laughter and love,
a simple pleasure...
a lifetime of memories.
