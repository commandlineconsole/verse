WOMAN OF TEHUANTEPEC
I am strong, devoted
Caring, Nuturing.
I am everything I can be.
Taking care of you, my main goal
Then me next.
I work for us,
I care for us.
Thats my only job.
When your sad, im sad
When your happy, I am too!
Im sure there are more like me in the world,
But, im here, your protector
Strong, devoted
Caring, Nuturing
The woman of Tehuantepec.
