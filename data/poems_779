THE JOYS IN MY LIFE
The Joys in my Life
The joys in my life
They are everything to me
And I will never let them go
The Joys are family, friends
The people in my life
My drawings, my music
But mostly
The people I hold dearly to my heart
And I couldn't ask for much more
But even I did ask
I don't think I would what to ask for
I have what I want
And could ever want
They bring joy in my life
I never would or could ask for more
What I have is dearly and forever
No matter what I will not let go of it
Not ever nor never
