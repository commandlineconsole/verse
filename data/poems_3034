HIDDEN SORROW
Only because i smile,
Doesn't prove my glee,
For my hidden sorrow,
Is now controlling me,
This sea of melancholy,
Is slowly drowning me,
Under the burning crimson sky,
And screeching black stars,
the contempt that boils within,
Creates only a greater sorrow,
This contempt for myself,
And the reproach I give myself,
This reproach I can't bear,
This abuse I can't withstand,
the torment and pain,
Feds my growing hidden sorrow,
