WHAT IS LOVE?
Love is kind
love is not rude
Love is hard to find
love is more than seeing them in the nude

Love is not anger
It keeps no records of  who's wrong
Love is more den giving ppl da finger
Love is about bein strong

Love is based on the Truth
It always protects
Love is not based on showin proof
cause it never infects

Love is always about trust
Love is more than hope
love is a must
love is being able to cope

Love never fails
Love is not pain
Sometime love can be hell
but love keeps u sane.

Love doesn't hurt
Love is caring
with love u will neva get treated like dirt
Love is about sharing

love... there's only one
love is something you should put above
love is fun
love is love.
