STRENGTH
I’ve seen the hatred in the world,
The judgement that follows,
Although all it is fear that completes the mask.
For we hide behind our insecurities,
Afraid to struggle underneath the waves,
Scared that if we fight back that everything will fall to pieces,
When really fear is such an inconceivable feeling,
Fear is only in our minds,
When left to our own devices we will imagine the worst,
What is real, however is the strength to realize fear doesn’t exist,
That fear no longer matters,
It is only than that you will discover who you really are.
