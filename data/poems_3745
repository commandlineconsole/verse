I DONT CARE, ITS LOVE I WANT
I dont care about the shoes you wear,
I dont care about the way you wear your hair.
I dont care about the way you dress,
I dont care if you come up here looking a mess.
But I do care about the way you love me, baby,
I care if you love me or not.
I care about you for who you are,
not for who you wanna be.
I wanna know if youre the one for me, baby.
I broke with you for a reason, honey.
I dont care if you poor and dont have money,
but its your love that im chasing, your heart
that im taking.I care about your love baby
