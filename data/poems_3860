WHAT I AM AND WHAT YOU ARE
Im not someone who can be defined
im not someone you can recognize along the line
who care what other think
who cares if girly girls like pink
we are who we are no matter what
who cares what others think its your cut
so yes i like the color blue
who cares about that, who! !
i don't like when people judge you
you judge yourself so you will get through
be who you are
because either way your a star :)
