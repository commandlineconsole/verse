MATERIAL BAND AIDS
society teaches materialism
as a band aid for tired souls
material delights new promise
sparkling but fade to normality
provide lease short term happiness...
but cannot address
our true spiritual needs
our hunger for love
understanding knowledge
God the universe all creation
society teaches materialism
as a band aid for the soul
material delights lust allure
may plead purchase swiftly
enticing packaged new sparkling...
