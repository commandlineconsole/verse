KEEPING OF SUCH STATEMENTS SPARED
The only concern I have,
Is keeping you aware...
That I 'am' concerned.
With the keeping of such statements spared.
If there is anything I've learned,
About being concerned.
It is better shown to produce the knowing,
When one is in the act of it.
Yes I care.
Do you dare to say I don't?
