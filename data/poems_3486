SUNDAY WAS VISITING DAY.
Sunday was visiting day
the day when briefly
as the visitors arrived
the locked ward
was unlocked
nurses on edge
eyes on the doors
patients on beds
or in chair
in the lounge
drugged up
or not so
depending on mood
or demons or how
far down
the deep pit
they’d gone
you can’t recall
Christine’s visitors
can’t remember
anyone there
but your mother
came through
the unlocked doors
carry smiles
and pinned in concerns
soft voice
smelling of perfume
or fresh air coming in
standing there
then sitting in the chair
by the bed
handing over sweets
or books or wash stuff
conversations
of how are you?
and what’s the food like?
are you feeling better?
were noted
and exchanged
your mother worried
lines on her face
in her eyes
swan deep concern
you saw Christine
over the way
standing by the window
looking out
then by the doors
waiting
arms folded
her nightgown
held tight
about her
her slipped feet touching
then the visitation over
the visitors gone home
the doors locked
the ward quiet
the patients subdued
staring into space
or at each other
gazing
into eyes
as blank as each others
depression deeper
nurses doing rounds
giving out drugs
listening acutely
to souls in torment
with their sad
silent sounds.
