JOY OF BLISS
Ah Ah, an expression of gladness,
Joy, Joy at the peak of time.
Moments with Bliss, times to behold.
Amending a fragile heart.
Joy like a river,
flowing side by side.
Selecting it time of rest,
But leaving one with a smile.
Just through a name, Happiness arrives,
By a word, hearts clicks.
No more sad moments, they exclaimed.
But just as Joy as Bliss
