DELIGHTFUL DANCER
Substance of  essence, dancer delights
Igniting the night with tangible might
Incinerator of germ and historical foe
In ovens of grease our waists to increase
Force of nature, portable sun
Brother of air, and also of bear
Domesticated by man, solicited by time
To send meek and wild ever to  run
In tales of the lost and also the found
Of ancient stakes and frozen lakes
Far flung places and many races
do many thrilling stories  abound
in legend or culture or  book
where men fear ghost and ultimate Host
humanity is still forged from destiny and iron
dancer delights, substance ignites.
