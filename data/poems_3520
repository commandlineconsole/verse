ILLUSION
Not concerned by what others think of me
it’s in no way my responsibility
what they do shatters before reaching my core
Fiery illusions, done with delusions
what we perceive is not apparent reality
eyes survey a projection of imagery
why do we base judgment on what we see
Thoughts design words we speak
words we speak direct to events we seek
reflection on the existence we lead and
that’s how we formulate beliefs
Don’t speak, accept my hand
shhh, I understand
Buzzing dragonfly can realize through the lies
fast changes occurring in the house of flies
lets bond as one by making wise ties
whilst the consumption of misunderstanding dies
Untrue promises can never stand tall
with no grounding they shall uproot and fall
In this moment we can see it all
we aren’t just another brick in the wall
Don’t speak, take my hand
Shhh, I understand
Not concerned by what others think of me
it’s in no way my responsibility
what they do shatters before reaching my core
