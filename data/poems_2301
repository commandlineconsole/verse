END IN FIRE
If anger was the beginning of this story then only in flames could it end
With strings so thin even a breeze makes them bend
That’s the rope which you walk on that’s the way I feel right now
I could shout and drag this on for days
Because my anger is surely enough to set even hell ablaze
You seem to know just what to say to make all my good go away
Now you’re stuck with a monster this fury, this danger
Yet you stand there unmoved by the calamity you sought
You stand there unshaved by the dread
You make me mad, drive me up a wall
It’s in anger that I write this all
Yet even reading it seems to be a moment for you to send me back to anger
Oh murder is all that’s left in me the last resort my retort
So as you sleep and rest tonight free of fright
My anger, my desire will be to set you on fire
