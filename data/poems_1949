CAMBODIA TRAVEL HAIKU - WOKEN UP BY KORAN READING
Seam Reap first surprise
i open the door to hear if
it is a koran recital
I was deeply surprised by the koran reading because I did not realise
the place i stayed actually had a sizeable muslim community. At home in Kuala Lumpur,  I could also hear such prayers every morning as Islam is the official religion in Malaysia. I really did not expect it in Cambodia. I heard that they were persecuted during the Pol Pot regime and many escaped the country to go to Thailand.
