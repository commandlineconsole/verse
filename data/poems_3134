RAIN, RAIN
Feels like this storm on top of head,
isn't going away.
Drowning in my pain and my sorrow,
trying to put my head on top of it.
I'm trying to get some air into my lungs,
cancer sticks live there now.
Once I get up from the pain and sorrow,
it hits me again without a warning.
I'm getting physically tired of swimming
to the top.
I can't tell if I'm emotionally tired,
cause the pain and sorrow has numb me
cold.
I've watched to movies where someone
could actually live a life.
I just can't get over that I don't have a life
like they do.
But, not everybody's story is like that.
Is it?
You can make a story, most of the time
it's already happened.
Nothing exaggerated.
So, please.
Help me from drowning in my pain and
sorrow.
