I LOVE
I love it when you kiss me
I love it when you are close
I love that you really care
I love it when you hold me
I love it how you'll always be there
I love how your so smart
I love your eyes
I love it when you make me laugh
I love it how when i'm around you i never cry
I love that you love me
I even love how when i am around you lose your thought
I love almost everything about you
I do absolutely love you
