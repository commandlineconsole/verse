I CARE
When you’re upset
When you’re down on your luck
Know that I Care.
When you feel the world
Has turned its back on you and
You seem to have lost your way
Know that I Care.
When you feel that you can’t go on
When you are being pulled
Into too many directions
Know that I Care.
When you need me to hold your hand or
Lend a shoulder for you to lean on
Know that I am there
Because I Care
