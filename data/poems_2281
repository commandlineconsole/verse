ANGER NONETHELESS
Slow to anger
And quick to anger
Anger nonetheless
You are the thief who has
Robbed me of all my patience
i will flee from your presence
i cannot promise my fists
Will relent
i wish you were a frog
You could change with just a kiss
To brace you will make me toad
i could fill pails with tears
How i loved you
And your love was a trick
A tug of an ear
You didn't know how
You loved me
And only thought of yourself
Your selfish deeds
When i flee do not be quick
To remember me
i was another one of your kicks
Was one of many
Be glad for me
That i don't have you
Slow to anger
And quick to anger
Anger nonetheless
