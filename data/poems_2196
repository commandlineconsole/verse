ANGER
Wake up every morning sad
Go to sleep every night mad
But why sad
Sad cause I’m alive
Mad cause of who I am
Mad that the world would never accept me
Mad cause I cant be me
Feeling like no heaven exist cause I’m living in hell
Feeling like there’s no angels to take me
So why should I smile
Why should I laugh
Why should I wake up every morning happy
Frustration and anger is taking over me every day
I’m living with no happiness
Living with anger
Anger is now my best quality
Anger describes my personality
Anger is inside of me
Anger is me
I’m anger
