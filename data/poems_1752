BLISS OF SOLITUDE
My heart is filled with pleasure
For happiness is a greta treasure
That comes for a little while
To spread in our way a smile
So grab this little time
That's flowing in life's rhyme
For it is the solitude's bliss
That you'll always miss
For it fills life with pleasure
For it is a great treasure.
