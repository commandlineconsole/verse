DON'T RUN FROM ANGER
Anti anger campaigns
Psychological  trend
Too much precaution
with behavior changes
Who hasn't felt a huge desire
of letting go a wolf howl
like a mad dog?
It's the  teacher's job to domesticate
It's also the parents destiny to disguise!
Precautions taken
crisis avoided
but...swallowed anger
unsolved sorrows
end up in hidden ilnesses
Therefore.......
Crying like a  mad dog is allowed
Shedding tears is consented soothing
and the extracted sorrow
remains us that to move on, means:
making choices!
