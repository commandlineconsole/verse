I TO YOU, AND YOU TO ME
No sword, no crown
The strength of humility
And the understanding
Of exactly one's self-worth
Measured in the depth of soul

Cast away the ego
Of attributions too
Delight in only what you are
The beauty that is essential
Not the make-up, nor the finery

I delight in you
For only who you are
Not who I am, nor wish for you to be

And you, delight in you
For all you truly are
No more, no less
That who you're meant
And called upon to be.......

I to you and you to me

As we walk along
Outward shells remain, empty
You and I frankincense infused, celebrating
To be I to you, and you to me
Our cup overflows
With wine that flows
Unending from the celestial cup
To be I to you, and you to me
Infused with Frankincense, from a special soul!
