FEAR'S FUNERAL
I went to a funeral today
Fear died and we buried it six feet deep
Everyone cheered nobody cried
And with fear
Resting in peace – now I can sleep
No, there wasn’t a eulogy
Our thoughts about fear were not uttered
Though I wanted to speak I had so much to say
However I would have just stuttered
It was then I realized how much power fear had
Not even death could
Get in its way
But I had to make sure fear was buried at last
So I attended its funeral today
