SADNESS
Sadness fills humans
Like an overflowing river
Sadness is vanquished only by joy
Joy will always conquer it
When sadness overflows
It comes out in tears
Tears will wash it away
Joy may come and help them
And then only wet spots will remain on one's face
That will be illuminated by joy's flaming lantern
A lantern that makes one's face shine
As it is reflected in the eyesâ€¦
