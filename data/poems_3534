'AMBASSADDRESSPEAK (REV.)
So concerned about our need –
offered Embassy protection, all
the needed services for one
whose Norwegian left him with-
out right to self-defence
Emails we exchanged were full
of pleasantries – his concern was
in preserving Norway’s fine,
untrammelled reputation as a
worthy nation – while
I had to kept a covert operation
under wraps; as much as guilty
secrets can inflate the way one
sees an enemy or friend, policing
my excitement really pleased
He was a stranger, yet his words
were pure diplomacy, messages
that sang with circumspect yet
pure respect; we agreed a truce
of privacy on who was who
It has agreed with me so much I
float on ambassadorial air, a dream
come true unusually - translating
in a world of words, I seldom see
magnificent grandiloquence
