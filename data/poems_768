JOY
Joy is the smell of sweet smelling flowers freshly picked from the garden.Joy tastes like a piece of rich chocolate cake all lovely and gooey. Joy sounds like the birds singing in the trees. Joy looks like a pretty forest filled with woodland creatures all scurrying around. Joy is the colour of a beautiful dress which is purple.Joy feels like your mum with her arms open wide in a joyful embrace, all fuzzy and warm. Joy reminds me of going out my friends like at the park all noisy and fun.
