OTHER
I do not have to be mad
For the anger to build up within me
I am a human being
Money and fame come and go
But we long for few things
I being a father of children
Become a child
I have a mother
But find a mother in other
When other does bother
I am the happiest

But when the other ignores
I go wild
Use words
Which are called obscene
Where's obscenity when
Everything is open
Give me a better word angel
I will change my language

Anger builds up from within
I am called mad
But a mad person rushes
For anything and everything
Sane seldom care
May be mad are better
In understanding the needs

Anger builds up from within
But anger is not anger
We are lost as ever for words
Give me a better word angel
I will change my language

Anger here is a hunger
I remain hungry for words
And for affection
Which I shower on the other all the time
Words never come
I see the tears
I cannot wipe
Who am I?
I can only cry

Anger will remain
I express
I am a child
Cannot hide my feelings
Please be my mother
You the other
You are distant
But other part of me
