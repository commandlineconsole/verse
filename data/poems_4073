FEAR
the feeling ruling and runing this world
the oldest sensation known to world
the emotion hard to bear
did you say, fear?
' no fear' is what i hear everyday
yet fear prevails in our hearts and stay
pain death war are usual fears
for which you say i dont care
well what about losing someone dear
now do you dare?
fear you see is every where
fear of not living upto your expectation
fear of not reaching your destination
fear of appearing mediocre
fear of unseen future
next time you say, i dont fear nothing
remember these lines; its not at all convincing
