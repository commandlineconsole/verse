IF SADNESS WERE MORE THAN AN EMOTION
If sadness had a smell
It would be flowers
Too many white roses fell
Upon the site of an early grave
If sadness had a color
It would be black
Close your eyes to see it
Regain your postrure you seem to lack
If sadness had a sound
It would be a heartbeat
Pounding in your head alone
Before his body loses heat
If sadness had a touch
It would be cool, sleek steel
Sliding across your skin
The pain of sadness, you'd feel
But sadness does have a taste
A tear on your lip
Knowing it's not your last
There are many more to come
