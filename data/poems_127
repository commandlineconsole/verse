MY  IDEA  OF  LOVE
Love is pure and sacred
Love is truth and everything good
Love is selfless and undemanding; giving and not expecting in return
It was love that gave India freedom
So love is Gandhi
Love gives us strength
Love makes us fearless
Love awakens the soul
Love enlightens the mind
Love gives us wisdom
Love is Mahaveer, Buddha, Christ & Allah
To love is to nurture
To love is to cherish
To love is to care &
To love is to heal
Love is Service
Love is Sacrifice
Love is life
And this life is Mother Teresa
