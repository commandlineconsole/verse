THE MAN'S PASSION'S
the man's passion's,
the man's passion's are his thought's,
the man that has a will,
the man that has a dream must posses the will to conquer,
the man's love that I had you in my mind,
the man that I got in me is making me new again,
let me sway and make way,
I got the will to find you seeing me,
my will is to have you in my life,
though man has the will to love and to posses other's,
we gotta love,
If we separate from human being's,
we'll be closer spiritually.
