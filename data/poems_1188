THE POET'S RIDE (CORRECT VERSION)
On the wings of Pegasus, borne in flight
Strings of images dance to my delight
Tempting the flow of reason and rhyme
On this great steed's back I ride
Searching and reaching for words that hide
Before they are lost in our clime
Now down to earth we must go
Steady as comets my words grow
This song of Poetry I write in rhyme
On the wings of Pegasus born this night
For you these words I write
My song of poetry shared our time
For the wings of Pegasus, now in flight
You danced your image to my delight
To your song, I thank Thee for our Rhyme
