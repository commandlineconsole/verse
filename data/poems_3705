DONT BELIEVE, THEY DONT CARE.
When the only person who cares isnt meant to,
Start to doubt,
When the only person who cares isnt meant to,
Feel at doubt,
They shouldnt care but they do,
Be grateful,
They shouldnt care but they do,
Feel grateful,
When a person acts lovely and caring,
Smile your best,
When a person acts lovely and caring,
Smile with the rest,
But when you learn that person is a fake,
Allow your heart to hurt,
But when you learn that person is a fake,
Give in to all the hurt,
People lie, dont believe,
People lie, dont trust,
People lie, dont listen,
People lie, betray your trust,
Dont allow yourself to feel,
Dont allow yourself to care,
Dont allow yourself happiness,
The world is too unfair,
