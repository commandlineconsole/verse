BLOOMING
Hold my breath,
Close my eyes,
Waiting for the ripping
Deep inside
Pleasure courses
Through my bones,
Filling my throat
With deep longing moans
Unimaginable
The pleasure so intense
Unthinkable
The need so immense
A flower blossoms
In the beginning of spring
Flowering most beautifully
Waiting for what life brings.
