YOUR NEXT HIT
If I asked you to stop
Would you listen?
If I said that I cared
Would it help?
Or is your only concern
That very next hit
Sending you into oblivion?
Why can't my body be enough?
Why the powders,
The syringes,
The vein filling poisons?
I'd give you a high you'd never forget
I just need you to come back down.
I'd take you to places you've never been
I just need you out of your slump.
I asked you to stop.
You wouldn't listen.
I told you I cared.
It didn't help.
Your only concern
Is your very next hit
Diving head first into oblivion.
My body's not enough.
I'm taking it away.
Your addiction can keep you warm at night.
