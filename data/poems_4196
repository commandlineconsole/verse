FEAR
A ball of memories
That hold my soul legacy
Take a look inside
The hand that holds the key
My grip is slipping
I do my best not fall
Slow motion plays
Fear of dropping the ball
I try hard to picture
Their worn out faces
The numbers the names
Our secret hiding places
This heartbeat it deafens
My sleepless nights
My fear cloud's
The brightest of lights
The onset of this plague
The why i'm insane
The reason im crying
The black acid rain
The fear it eats me
Chews me up and spits me out
Laughs at my pain
Complains when i shout
Fear of death
Fear of my ancestors demise
Fear of loneliness
No longer looking into their eyes
