A WHOLE MYSTERY...
Life is a whole mystery
it drives you to learn
Unbelievable things
in undescriptible ways
It left you the deepness scars
While gives you the best friends
to share
to love
to feel
to understand
to live...
Life is a whole mystery
And the most amazing
and sarcastic discovery that I've made
...is myself
Believe it or not
Even sounds crazy or not
Thereâ€™s no way to stop surprising with myself
Maybe because I'm a girl (gender things you know!)
Maybe cause I do think too much
But the point is that
Any time I am totally sure
about something about myself
I just get surprised again
Carrying more than I thought I could
Suffering more that I thought I could
Giving more than I thought I could
... Loving more than I thought I could
So, life is a whole mystery to me
So am I!
