ON SAND TRACK
We walk barefoot on sand tracks
Leaving behind foot prints with nothing at stake
Within moment they will disappear
You need not look back or see from rear
Laughter is no free commodity
That is inbuilt and smells of humanity
You can crate or ignore
What else you can ask as more?
Eyesight is not a reason to worry
Immobility is not concern to feel sorry
We have lived life to its full length
Now why worry if that is taken over by death
We have lot more to share
As we were looked after with care
Let nature play its part and take us away
This is only right thinking to part the way
We remember almighty as creator
Our true guide, philosopher and mentor
What would have been we if not brought on this earth?
Let us faith due respect and unstinted faith
We gave to the world or family what ever we could
Now let them think about us or what they should
We are now lest concerned about what they may think
We have still enough of time on ship before it sinks
Let the end be also memorable and exemplary
Each stage has been made important are necessary
Like seasons change and leaves fall by taking clue
We must think only in those terms which are worth to view
