SURPRISE
If there’s one thing I’d wish for when I die
Then it is to be taken by a great surprise
I’ve traveled to many peculiar places before
I hope death would give me something more
I want to lie down on the floor
And sleep like I’ve never slept before
And pretend like there’s no ceiling above
And dream of things I’ve never dreamt of
And write them down, like I always do
The things that I’ve struggled to pursuit
Oh, the things that I couldn’t quiet visualize
But the things that had took me by surprise
Oh, I am one with the evening sky
We’re both dreaming of you tonight
Falling from the edge as long as we’re alive
Hoping that you’d catch us here by surprise
Every night, we die a little inside
Every night, we die a little inside
We die a little inside as long as we’re alive
Hoping that you’d catch us here by surprise
