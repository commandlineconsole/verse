DON'T LOOK INTO HER EYES
I wish I could be as naive as you
Some times, just watching the world
Like it's some bible story
A morality tale, where we do no wrong
How I wish it was like that
But I grew up in the real world
A northern child from a broken home
And I saw what people do
And I heard what people think
It doesn't shock me
It doesn't surprise me
I understand that people sin
Yeah, and I join in...
So when you pull that face
Of shear disgust and hate
Iâ€™m more surprised by your reaction
Than what the man has done
So close your mouth
And settle down
Yeah people degrade themselves
And if that's what they want
Then let them, let them
But when you read these words
You'll be stunned that I write anything
You're unable to believe
That I can create as well as you
It shouldn't shock you
It shouldn't surprise you
Just understand that people sing
Yeah, and I join in!
