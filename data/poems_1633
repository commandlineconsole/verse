KNOWLEDGE
If we had true insight
We would be scared to death,
We would not be able to see anything,
We would see everything and see nothing.
Senses empower limitations,
Senses expand vision within borders,
Senses promote understanding through pleasure.
Without pleasure there is no sight or measure.
Total knowledge is annihilation
Of the desire to see, to touch, to feel
The world sensed only through senses
And immune to the knowledge without feeling.
