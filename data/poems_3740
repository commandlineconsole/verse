SILVER LINING (A TRIBUTE TO GEOMETRY)
Sent a note home to my mom
Expecting it to be a bomb
But my mom hates my teacher
And her whining
And the fact that I don’t care
Is silver lining
I have failed
And there’s no catching up
So I’ve decided I’ve had enough
And if you care then that’s just tough
The phone is ringing for my mom
Expecting it to be a bomb
But my mom hates my teacher
And her whining
And the fact that I don’t care
Is silver lining
I have failed
To the extreme
Passing this class
Is beyond my dreams
No motivation when there’s no catching up
And if you care well then that’s just tough
Sent a note home with me
Expecting me to drown in misery
But I hate her and her whining
And the fact that I don’t care
Is silver lining
I have failed
And I don’t care
She’s raining Hell
It’s so unfair
I am sick of her
And her whining
The fact that I don’t care
Is silver lining
I have failed
Beyond repair
This class is Hell
And I don’t care
I’m sick of her
And her whining
And the fact that I don’t care
Is the silver lining
