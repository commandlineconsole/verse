PI-GEON!  MESSENGER OF PEACE
Flutters his golden wings with speedy might,
Near the bright sun under divine light,
Flying high in azure world he delights,
Laments world beneath, crawling in draughts.
Watches helplessly from the snowy heights,
Drops like a cannon light,
Message of peace and brotherhood delights,
Without any quota, creed and race flights.
Bears a flag of hope and peace around,
Scented gifts designedly bound,
Bearing the names of loves and loved,
Gives what one deserved,
Happy cause and happy lines preserve,
Victory and success in rainbow color serve.
