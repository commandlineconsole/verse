FEAR OF...
Fear of one thing
Fear of many things
Fear of winning nothing, but just losing
Fear of life and what is called death
Fear of being too happy, only to get hurt again
Fear of something becoming nothing
Fear of losing something of much value
Fear of love becoming hate
Fear of being liked or disliked, is of the same
Fear of misunderstanding what is understood by others
Fear is of many things
But what makes fear?
