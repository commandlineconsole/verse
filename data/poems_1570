LUSH VACATION
A place where beauty is a treasure,
To behold one's period for leisure
That conveyed one to a pleasure
Past one's wildest dreams in huge measure.
So much one has derived from leisure,
Serenity felt beyond measure.
That place, green with joy, one did treasure
For it gave one a lot of pleasure.
Everything from that place, is a treasure,
Fine for one to have in great measure.
A lot for one to have for leisure,
A lot to give one so much pleasure.
Loaded with serenity, that pleasure
Is to one the most wondrous treasure,
So lush with fortune in great measure.
All to be enjoyed in one's leisure.
