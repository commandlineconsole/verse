I LOVE...
I love you
I love those deep hazel eyes
I love the sweet lullabies
I love your lips, so soft and pink
I love the way you speak, you think
I love you
I love the way you kiss my hair
I love the way you act, without a care
I love you you don't like to fight
I love how peaceful you look when you sleep at night
I love you
I love the way you firmly hold me
I love the way you are so free
I love the way you laugh, the way you feel
I love that I know these feelings are real
I'll love you forever <3
