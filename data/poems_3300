YET TO SAY
I feel your might,
Because it is my right
I got the right
From my might,
Right from the heart
Of my might, who is there for me and in me.
I feel and feel, I care and care
Because I am concerned
My care is my concern and my concern
Is my feeling of my care
What to say, What not to say
But there is a lot to say
I don't know how to say
I tried to say, but it is yet to say.
