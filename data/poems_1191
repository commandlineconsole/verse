LIFE'S DELIGHT
Yellow, Gold, warm hues of Red are
forever the suns glowing happiness,
upon the sea the sparkling shimmer
and green heaped mounds forever holler,
they always seem to somewhat follow.
Natures delight such as flowers always
shine with all its might, and the leaves
blow to the winds delight. Following a
course to a new life.
I wonder where it will eventually lie?
far beyond the joys of the trees light,
and across the ways to the smiles of
the sunrise.
