DIE IN LOVE
If I die I die in love
If I fly I fly with love
Love is the foundation of my life
The pillar of my life
My life till date is controled in love
Love killed me and yet am alive for love
Love died but still gave me life
What can I do in this life if love  is not in the plan
Love made me
I hate myself when I lack love
My life is love made
Love made me love to be loved
