KILL ME
Kill me sweetly
kill me softly
I let you hurt me
I let you use me
slowly taking my life
slowly breaking my mind
I can't handle this anymore
I can't ignore this  anymore
Tell me why you do this
Tell  me why you need this
Do you take pleasure in my pain
Do you take pleasure in my sorrow
Must I cry
For you to laugh
Must I scream
For you to smile
