WHEN I THINK OF BIRDS
When I think of birds I think of forms-
liberation in the sky
unfettered wings flying high
When I think of love
I think of passion
and of pain
When I think of death
If I think of death
I think of death
When I think of you
I think your song is true
warming icy rain
I look at pleasure
and look at pain
I look at laughter in the rain
I look at hope
and at despair
I pray, I never make it there
You are my pleasure
and my pain
you are my laughter in the rain
Words, my love, do not fail
you are my passion
greater than all flesh
you are my hope
you are my death
