THE ONE
I found the one
The one for me
At first it was too
Obvious to see
Short and sweet
Just like a shortcake
I don't know what she was
But she knew how to shake
She had the body of a Goddess
And character for days
Everywhere she went
She had me looking both ways
She could sing like Mariah
Walk like Naomi
And just like Ashanti
She knew how to put it on me
Everything was sweet
Like peaches and cream
But just like Biggie said
It was all a dream........
So i laid back down
Rubbin my eyes
Because surprise surprise
I was feeling them cry
