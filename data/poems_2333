SPOKEN IN ANGER
Words spoken in anger can burn deeper than you think
You don’t consider feelings when you’re standing on the brink
There are no set limits to restrict the words you say
Anger strips the boundaries and your conscience is betrayed
I didn’t mean to hurt you, I retorted in defence
You say the lowest taboos when the moment is intense
The words I spoke in anger left you running for the door
But now’s the time to clear the air, just like we have before.
