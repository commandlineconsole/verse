LET LOVE
Let love be in let love be out
Let love be in-between
Let love suppress each foolish doubt
That hinders Jesus’ queen
Let love my God with me reside
Let love precede my goal
Let love turn back the devil’s tide
And bless my heart and soul
Let love restrain my worldly stress
Let love my life adorn
Let love my aching heart caress
Let love in me be born
Let love persuade my every thought
Strengthen my days when weak
Let love flow through the true report
Each day my tongue would speak
Let love go forth and onward Lord
Let love defend my rear
Let love turn back Your vengeful sword
And lead me whilst I’m here
Let love all hate in me restrain
Let love be always pure
Let love look through my window pane
And in and out my door
Let love’s true Flame inside me burn
Let love inside me thrive
Let all the world my God soon learn
True love can all survive
Let love survey my wayward past
Let love my God forgive
When love’s prevailed life’s stormy blast
Allow this child to live
