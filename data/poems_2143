THE MIRACLE OF LIFE
One Morning in May I arose from my bed,
Stretching, squinting, and yawning;
I looked out my door and to my surprise
I saw beneath my awning;

A robin's nest, so sleek and trim
And in the center resting,
With eyes half closed, sat Mother bird
Patiently nesting.

For two more weeks I watched the scene
Unfolding before my eyes;
And then today when I looked up
I saw to my surprise,

Three small bird with open beaks,
Waiting for their food.
Another of God's miracles,
To prove He's great and good.
