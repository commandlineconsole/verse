WHY SHOULD GOD CARE FOR ME?
WHY SHOULD GOD CARE FOR ME?
Why should God care for me?
I am one of the billions living now
And one of the many more billions who have been
And one of the probably even more billions who will be-
I will only be on this earth for an infinitesimal interval
Of all the Time that has been and will be-
I live on one small dot on a small insignificant planet
In a universe so vast no human will ever know or see it whole-
I am a small part of all that is itself so small
Why should God care for me?
Why should God care for me?
When there is so much else to care for?
So many other people better than me in so many different ways
More righteous more kind more just more talented-
Why should God care for me
When I am one small mediocrity in a world of far greater beings?
Why should God care for me
When in me there is lust and hunger and envy and ambition?
Why should God care for me
When I am so bound up with concern for myself,
That I think of myself far more than anyone else?
Why should God care for me?
Why should God care for me?
Why should God care for me
When millions suffer and die each day
Why should God care for me?
Why?
