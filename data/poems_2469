ANGER AND ANGUISH
You leave these memories you don't need,
To fade away.
Who wants to remember...
People so driven with their no hiding hate.
Who wants to remember...
When truth became for us outdated.
And deceit became the bait,
That was related and we ate it.
Who wants to remember...
This.
Who wants to remember...
Anger and anguish.
