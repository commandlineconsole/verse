FEAR LOVE
I fear love
like the wild fox
always so ready to bite
to devour its heart’s delicacy
I fear the lightening bolt of love
like the hidden venomous snake
poised to strike the soul
not knowing where, till its fallen
I fear the hungry love
happily gnawing away
on the meat of my heart
leaving stains in its feasting wake
I fear accepting love
its safer to freely give away
than accept, commit
and admit a heart’s necessity
I fear your love
exposing my true weakness
that I may not be able
to live without it
