THE CLOWN’S SORROW
Sorrow wrapping his face,
Sat a man in a park.
An old man got to him
And made a chat with him.
He suggested to him,
‘Go to the circus yonder
And watch the clown’s action.
You can forget your sorrow
And have a heart-full laugh’
‘I am the very clown’
Said the man in sorrow.
The one who makes others
Laugh can very well wear sorrow.
