WHAT ARE FRIENDS
Friends are those who keep his anger aside from his friend
Friends are those who understand misunderstandings
Friends are those with whom no network needed
They talk by the vibration
They see themselves closing eyes
They feel themselves without being in touch
Friends are those who never say goodbye
Friends are those who don't make one anger the last
They accept such angers, misunderstanding may come again and again.
