DAWN BREAK
stillness ruled
oh, in this bleak
may day night
not even a single
crickets chirp
has reached my ears - -
stillness cavernously
deafening,
silence reverberates,
scorned the heart
with grief and sorrow,
why having to live
alone in this weak
and frail resting home
drowned you to mourn?
mourn, in the sorrows
of your own,
in vain i scream,
in plight, I complain
transient sorrow
only leaves the soul
with scars and stain,
then a voice from
within I heard,
whispering,
'sleep, sleep
that your sorrow
may break,
break together
with the dawn'
