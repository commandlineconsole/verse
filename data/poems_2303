ANGER
Anger or short temper; whatever is the name;
It is sure to hang heads in shame.
This leaves behind rational thinking.
What it carries along is mind blocking!
Anger suffers from ‘ sanity blindness’.
Its outburst is ridiculed as sheer madness.
Anger will never reach a correct decision.
It always attracts strong opposition.
All it earns is total displeasure.
More often than not, this leads to discomfiture.
This frustration reaches frightening heights.
Fall from that altitude, definitely hurts.
Let not anger engulf you.
And do something dangerously new.
To keep disaster at bay;
Anger management is the best way.
