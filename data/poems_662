AIRBORNE
Our recipe for passion seals our end,
Our passion for intensity is where we begin
Can you see the picture of where we will go
Hold out for a parachute before leaping from the window
Why dont you come back inside
Its cold outside and the ledge is miserably steep
You can rest your head within me confide
One minute at a time we can capture and keep
