SORROW
Sorrow is a Serpent,
It enwraps itself around me
Snapping bones & crushing organs
So asphyxiating...
The Fang's of Sorrow
break my flesh, poison
rushes through my body
paralyzing every limb...
Sorrow devours my Soul,
Sorrow is so Fatal
Poison corrodes my Life,
but It doesn't seem to matter...
Anymore..
