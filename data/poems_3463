YOU ARE AMONG THE ONES I LOVED
They do more than talk about me,
and say when I look at the sea
that there I see a woman ghost,
where she comes and talks to me
They know that looking at the sea,
I see far beyond,
and there I find you again,
and I find a light in the darkness.
Why are they concerned about me
I want them to  let me suffer,
I cried the great love I gave you,
for now that is how i want to live
I closed the doors so i can be alone,
so that way i can always remember you
I dont ever want to forget you
because that is not a place for you,
you are among the ones I loved,
although I lost you.
They laugh when talk about me
because I believe in love,
and say I went crazy
that I'm dying of pain.
Why so many concerned with me
I want them to let me suffer in peace,
I cried the great love I gave you,
for now that is how i want to live.
