WITH JOY
I am joy...
With joy, you were born
With joy, you were a baby
With joy, you cried
With joy, you smiled
With joy, you laughed
With joy, you sleep
With joy, you walked
With joy, you matured
With joy, you were healed
With joy, you fought
With joy, you never gave up
With joy, you world peace
With joy, you made me
