MARIGOLDS (AN ACROSTIC POEM)
My window stands above the patch
And looks down at those gold delights.
Resting under the shadow of my panes
Inviting me frequently to come and glance.
Gazing, I start to brood over times spent
On old friends, laughter and frolic.
Lying under the mangrove slapdash
Dancing gold patch happy on our sides.

Same gold delights but a different me today.
