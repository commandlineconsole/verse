FIRM LAUGHTER
How it has been so ever just
That laughter did turn to rock,
Lifted itself up to stand
That sadness did turn to dust.
Life of sadness, it did block
Has made sadness go well bland.
Air of joy has been that must
From fine moods in laughterâ€™s stock.
Laughter, with its power at hand,
Has never fallen short to bust.
Its power withstands every shock,
That laughter stays forever grand.
