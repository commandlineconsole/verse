MY SISTER IN IRELAND
It was a shock to all, a surprise to me
my cousin marrying an Irish girl
All the clouds mooring up in the sky,
the news a thunderbolt!
I met her six years since their marriage,
they came to attend grandma's funeral.
All the men talking about,
walking in, I saw  a lad so sweet
His face, red as a cherry,
playing with other children in the yard
the sight, Ryan! a surprise
My cousin addressed his wife.
my Ireland sister to me, Clair!
Happy  thoughts! to accept a foreigner?
No! she is no more a foreigner
We talked a lot, she was a marvel
in her conduct, soft spoken.
Her attire changed, dressed in churidar!
Now she is a MALAYALEE!
I heard Ryan, calling 'chechi'
A surprise, the sweety learned malayalam.
Two days later, they came home.
A surprise ! the Happy Union.
