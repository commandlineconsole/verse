DON’T BE SURPRISED
When I rip the spine out of your back and use it to choke you
- don’t be surprised
When I rip your eyeballs out and lead you into a bottomless pit
- don’t be surprised
When I sneak up behind you and snap your neck in several different directions
- don’t be surprised
When I hit you in the spine so hard it runs all the way up the cord and causes cerebral damage
- don’t be surprised
So when you go to sleep tonight don’t be surprised if you don’t wake up
