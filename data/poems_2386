MY MISTAKE
I have made the mistake
Of letting my anger and frustration
Get control over my actions
Before I could ever stop them.
Because of this happening
I have lost the one person
That has ever understood me completely
Over something unforgivable.
I have lost her because of my anger
That was never at her nor caused by her.
Only one thing has caused me
To conceal and generate that amount of anger.
She can never know now
That that night in that room
I never really saw her
Only my father within.
She canâ€™t know that now
Because of the mistake I made
Of letting that anger
Overcome my own body and soul.
