FEAR
I fear the struggle
I fear the strife
A fear of death
A fear of life
I fear for you
I fear for me
I fear of what
Will come to be
There's plenty to fear
Than fear itself
I fear the pain
and fear poor health
I fear my well
Is running dry
I fear so much
I'm forced to cry
I fear disaster
I fear the knife
I fear the blade
That is my life
I fear the man
I came to be
I fear the dark
And fail to see
I fear life's left me
On the shelf
I fear so much
It harms my health
I fear the help
For which I cry
I fear success
I'm scared to try
