ARE YOU SAD?
You sound so sad,
Are you really
Sad?
Is your garden
Without any
Flower?
I am sad.
You doubt the sound
Of
My sadness?
What does
Sadness really
Sound
Like?
Does it sound like
A seagull’s journey
Along soundless
Stream on a
A dimming orange
Sunset, at the
Sea’s
Horizon
Homeward bound
Alone?
Is sadness in
True sadness
Sound at
All?
Is sadness not the
Maimed mouth
& death of the
Tongue?
The sound of my sadness
Is the sound of your
Sadness
You read me
In between
Some lines
In that imaginary
Phrase
Perhaps if you look for
Some flowers, or
Even a single flower
In-there
You may find it
If you really
Insists
But
You have to put
The flower
Yourself
Out-there
Sowing the seed
Of sensitivities
Who knows
If later, happiness
Grows
Like some unwanted
Weeds &
They would be many,
Not just one.
