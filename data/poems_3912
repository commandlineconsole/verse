I CARE HYMN
I care that people have mercy for one another
I care that people learn to live together in this planet called earth and Around the world
I care that children will be breastfeed by their mothers because that is the Food that children after birth needs
And in this breast milk are all the vitamins and minerals that the child that Was just born needs
I care that people can't read my mind and know my thoughts because only I know my thoughts and I know myself
