THE WORLD IN MY EYES
The world. A harsh place, yet
through the harshness of its existence comes
a ray of light, brought by passion,
passion from the existence of the human race
of individuals making peace, love, violence,
A contrast.
The world, a place of ever growing pain and hate,
the place once fuelled on love cannot breathe, is dying without pain.
Think.
The world once powered by unity is sickened without grief.
