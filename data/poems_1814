SURPRISE! SURPRISE!
Surprise! Surprise!
It's a surprise party!
Surprise! Surprise!
For you - lovely buddy!
Surprise! Surprise!
Let your joy like a jet rise!
The friends will give you a prize
Whilst you and I sit and eat rice!
Surprise! Surprise!
Your sweet soul none should forsake,
Surprise! Surprise!
As friends and family gather for your sake!
Surprise! Surprise!
I'll cut the candy cake!
Surprise! Surprise!
Something for you I did bake!
Surprise! Surprise!
It's a token of appreciation,
given though without your anticipation -
it's a party of sublime surprise!
Surprise! Surprise:
To herald my greatest of gratitudes,
Surprise! Surprise:
wishing you best of beatitudes!
Surprise! Surprise!
You're a true hero!
Surprise! Surprise!
You're worth more than Nero!
It's a surprise party,
Surprise! Surprise!
Surprise! Surprise!
For you - lovely buddy!
