MAKE ME CLEAN
To survive from day to day
I have to find a way
To put away my selfish heart
Ineglected my cross
I focused on my loss
I need a brand new start
May my timidness and shame
Become lost in your name
Make me clean, make me new
Take my cross up like you
Make me blind to all animosity around
Grant me joy with no shame
To dance at your name
With my eyes on your throne and my knees on the ground
Make me clean
You have been in my shoes
People saying you'll lose
But with joy you kept on walking
I want people to see
Your endurance in me
And a faith that's not just talking
May my timidness and shame
Become lost in your name
Make me clean, make me new
Take my cross up like you
Make me blind to all animosity around
Grant me joy with no shame
To dance at your name
With my eyes on your throne and my knees on the ground
Make me clean
Though i try and try i fail
But your joy helps me prevail
Though this tempting world distracts me
Help me refocus honestly
(And then the chorus twice)
