MY WORSHIP OF SORROW - ORIGINAL BY RABINDRANATH TAGORE
My worship of sorrow is not yet over;
I shall lit up all the lamps of my sorrow
At the end of the day for my last prayer.
When birds return to the nest
In the shadow of the evening,
When the bell of evening worship is rung in the evening
Then this life will lit up its last flame-offer
And my worship of sorrow will be over.
So many words of my so many days
So many yearnings in so many ways
My mind is full of these things now-a-days!
When in the sacrificial fire
They will burn like the stars
And they will rush towards the sky ignoring barriers
Then my arrangement will match sunsetâ€™s color
And my worship of sorrow will be over.
