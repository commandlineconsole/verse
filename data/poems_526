HIDDEN  PASSION
Hidden Passion,
stored locked away the  thought  of  passion forgotten,
yet,  lingering  in  distance  air  passages.
How does one  recapture these  floating
Ever  so  soft  clouds of  passion
to be able to put back these whispering breezes of desire?
If only it could be stored  in  a  bottle
to  be  later mixed with  an enticing fragrance
that  is  activated  by  gentle  slow embraces  of  love-making
and soft touching  one to the other
this  scent  that  refills  the  air
getting stronger  with  each  moment
as the passion  in  the  both  of  you  heats up!
