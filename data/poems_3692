I STILL CARE
I still care for all those little things you’ve said
And for your spoon collection hidden in the den
I still care that you’re getting older every day I go
And that you feel alone even when I come back home
I still care that your car won’t start as often as you wish
And that you have to work harder than you ever did
I still care when you can’t sleep
And when I hear your cries hidden away from me
I still care for your despair
And for the next color you’ll wear on your hair
I still care when I’m far away
And that you wish you were here with me
I still care when you call me daughter
And I know I’m home when I hear your laughter
I still care for you, mother
And I hope you know, for me, there is no one other
I still care for you, mother
I still care for you
I still care for you, mother
I still care, I do
