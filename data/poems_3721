CARING
Millions and millions of faces
Of people we don’t know
They live around the world
All colours and creeds
But with an outstretched hand
We can care for them all
Caring is something
That comes naturally
We care for our loved ones
As they grow old
We care for our children
The new seeds we’ve sowed
Caring is a natural thing
We do it all the time
We never really realize
But we do it all the same
It is only when someone thanks us
That we realize we care
