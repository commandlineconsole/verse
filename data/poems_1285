IN THE PARK
How Mother Nature
dances
in such radiant delight
of her beauty
such magnificence
cannot be challenged
in Picasso’s palette
or van Gogh’s trembling
optic delight
to imprint the same
Fall brings for us
such ecstasy in colours
imagery beyond
brush strokes
of May Stevens
or Emil Noble
here our appetite
for Life
is living with Nature.
