I TAKE DELIGHT
I take delight
To see birds take flight
To see clouds
Ramble through the sky.
I take delight
To see trees rustle in the breeze
Or a bright rainbow
Unfurl  a colourful show.
I take delight
To see a burbling fountain
Or behold the sun set
Behind the lofty mountains.
I take delight
In thousands of such small things
That lightens up the heart
And joy brings.
I take delight
That God has bestowed us with sight,
And aesthetic might
That provides us an insight.
