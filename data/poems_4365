SCREAM
I watch every night as my door closes,
Lumps of fear take a solid form,
In my throat does a storm of fear take place,
Burning my eyes, crying tears so warm
The darkness enlopes me,
Sealed me with a kiss,
A promise of a night without rest,
The daylight I would miss
The sounds once innocent,
Take the fear of death, a deadly shout,
Everything is dangerous,
When the lights go out
My breath once smooth,
Now haggard with fear,
The nights seem to chuckle,
It's dark, nothing is clear
The whisper of wind,
Sounds like a storm of screams,
It disturbs by being,
It haunts my dreams
I fear the night,
The sun going out,
It means the time is coming,
When my fear comes about
A childish worry,
But a fear nonetheless,
I hear the whispers, the warnings,
Only I know them best
A repeated taunting,
An evil caress,
The night does haunt me,
It will not let me rest.
