LOVE AND LOVE
Love Love and Love
Like Hatred is Blind
To even have a peep
At the Glow of your Love
Love under the Sun
Rain Moon and Stars
For a cheer from the Skies
Love like its all you Have
To live and die for
So Soundly clam
Goes the taste of Love
So motherly a comfort
A lullaby to Stress
That only hearts can Sing
With a feeling beyond Real
Love so Sweet and White
That Honey is so Bitter
Like Snow is so stained
Give Love the Glitter
That treats Gold deem
Bright and Blinding
Eat with that love
Love at every Eye Blink
Love at Breath Intervals
Love with your Heart beat
LOVE LOVE and LOVE
Until that Smile Freezes
On Your face Forever
