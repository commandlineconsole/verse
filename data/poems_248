MY LOVE IS MY WORLD
I love you
My love is necessary
For the physics
For the chemistry
For the world
For the good of all
For all suffering
Humanity of the world.
I love you
And there is need
For the love
Love is my science
Love is my art
Love is the process
Love is the beginning
Love is the end.
I love you
My love is absolute
My love is practical
My love is final
I love you
My love is my world.
