DAWN'S THE LIGHT!
Dawns the light!
So very bright!
Questions become answers!
Why? Why not!
At last the unknown becomes clear.
The worry, the wait,
Unnecessary fear.
Imagination creates
To fill the space.
Between known and unknown.
It bridges gaps and gullys
With whatever is put there
By the mind in it's current state
Of concern or care.
So a worried care
Becomes a worried fear,
And joyful thoughts
Become joyful scenes,
And a careful concern
Becomes a careful response.
Where perhaps there is
Nothing to support
The ideas of imagination,
So the picture becomes unclear.
Until in a moment relaxed,
The answer appears,
And Glory! What a light!
So Very bright!
