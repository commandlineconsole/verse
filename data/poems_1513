PLEASURE
I have seen a princess
In a dream restless
I gave her a kiss
She gave me a kiss
And we sought to unite
All through the night
In our loverâ€™s brawl
Pleasure to all
Sparks and lights
Sounds and sights
Our love could be seen
My queen and me, her King
We ruled our land
The woman in charge of the man
Relinquished my dominion
For the greater good of union
Our reversal of roles
Attainment of goals
Heightened pleasure,
Unrelenting pleasure
Given to each other
Shared between me and my lover
