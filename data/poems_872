I'VE GOT JOY
Deeper than the deepest of Oceans
Higher than the heavens from the Earth
Wider than the widest of all
Yet not out of reach, available to all.
Available to pick me up when I fall
To wipe my tears away
And shower my heart with Peace and joy
Overwhelming my inner-man with calmness.
Like a river joy in my heart flows
Not bowing to the season of the barren.
You've become my closest companion
All for the for the sacrifice made on the Cross.
Now I can afford to sing;
'I've got Joy like a river in my soul'
'I've got Joy that no man can give'.
Inexhaustible Joy flows within me all 'cos of YOU.
