NOW I KNOW LIFE BETTER
A long walk to the end of the earth, I took a sneak in to the cauldrons of time,
I saw there were a little joy, a little hope and a little sorrow and loads of tomorrow
I held my hand out in to the pot, to collect some joy,
I grabbed tinsels of joy that kept slipping away in shy
Each time I had sorrow maul the joy and wreck it or pry
There again I saw hope pouring in with a wry,
And wash away all the sorrow and leave tinsels of joy,
Every time I thought I would hold on to the sequins of joy,
I would see time the cauldron of joy roil in tempo of fire
It would roar and then heave a deep sigh,
Again, I would try to gather tinsels of joyâ€¦..
