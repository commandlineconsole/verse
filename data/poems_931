TRIOLET
Farewell, sweet stranger... my love, my joy,
for the love I had carried for you is gone,
having faded forever into nothingness.
Farewell, sweet stranger... my love, my joy,
I had given myself up
to the inevitable truth of eternal loneliness.
Farewell, sweet stranger... my love, my joy,
for the love I had carried for you is gone.
