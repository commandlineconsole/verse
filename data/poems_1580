END THIS PAIN
wishes dont really matter since theres no genie in my bottle
just a half empty sort of pleasure thats supposed to end my pain
promises are worthless if theres no one there to keep them
just a half empty sort of pleasure thats supposed to end my pain
with each swallow i feel smaller sinking farther deep within
forgetting why that constant throbbing echoes in my heart
i gave up help from outside sources
screw you if you plan to judge me
im over helpless wanderings that kept me up at night
and here i'll stay secluded in my cloudy foggy mind.
wishes dont really matter since theres no genie in my bottle
just a half empty sort of pleasure thats supposed to end my pain
promises are worthless if theres no one there to keep them
just a half empty sort of pleasure thats supposed to end my pain
three days ago i bought it and now they lay heaped upon my floor
but it doesnt really matter guests will give up when i refuse the door
my eyes are red from crying those endless gasping tears
but with the loss of sleep at hand it wont be leaving soon
that thick gold chain you bought me lays heavily on my neck.
forever going to stay there with a hole thumping beneath
wishes dont really matter since theres no genie in my bottle
just a half empty sort of pleasure thats supposed to end my pain
promises are worthless if theres no one there to keep them
just a half empty sort of pleasure thats supposed to end my pain
you left this world and left me here alone without a soul
and here i am in wishing i could join you in that hole
i wont be going anywhere, your memories dance here
forget it if you ask me how could you even dare?
six feet six feet six feet of darkness muddy dirt
wishes dont really matter since theres no genie in my bottle
just an empty sort of pleaure thats supposed to end my pain
promises are worthless if theres no one there to keep them
just an empty sort of pleasure thats supposed to end my pain
six feet six feet six feet of darkness muddy dirt
