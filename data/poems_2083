ELEMENTS OF LOVE
it's the blossom of love that surprises me,
its bloom even in the autmest of autumn.
fear, joy, pain are all its elements,
so beautifully blended as the diamond,
break apart yet it continues to shine with joyful memories.
it's the wildness of love that surprises me,
a commix of commitment and passion.
dedication, wildness, insanity are all its elements,
so beautifully blended as the amazon in the amazon,
the path and the destination exist together.
it's the purity of love that surprises me,
purer than the snowy snow of eden.
blindness, innocence, faithfulness are all its elements,
so beautifully blended as the adam himself
even the decree by the almighty broken
the supreme form of God,
the chaste form of worship,
it's the desire of every entity,
but still so rare,
it's not the elements that make the love great,
they have taken birth from the love itself.
