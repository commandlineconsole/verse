176.THE GIFT OF MIRACLES
For the life so static
Hope is the wing
Perching in the soul
Learning from yesterday
Living for today
Hope is for tomorrow
Hope is the dream
Of the soul while awake
Dancing without music
Hope is a pillar
That holds up the world
Waiting for lifting people so high
Hope begins in the dark
Steering for the dawn
Driving mission success
Flight not from pleasure to pleasure
But from hope to hope
As nothing is left to gape
Humanity being ocean
A few drops dirty
Doesnâ€™t turn it filthy
More pleasant to travel
Than the road built in despair
Though destination is same
