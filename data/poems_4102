FEAR
Fear sometimes takes over,
Fear  is sometimes wonderfull
but this is the thing everyone has had fear once in there life
it might be small or it might be huge
fear is what brought people together in the thick of things we cant ever suspect when fear is going to hit us
in the end fear just manages to leave and my only fear is dying alone
my mom hasnt always been there for me but she tryed her best as long as i made her proud her fear was losing what was dear to her
