FEELING VOID
This is to the end
Feeling giving up
Undisclosed fight
Cheeky cheerful of
“SHAME”
Coz that’s
Nobody matters
If not ourselves
Who care for?
This to the end
Feeling void
Entangling fight
For not personal,
“NEGLECTED”
Coz that’s
Concerned nobody
Of ours selfishness
If doesn’t concerned
Oneself,
Who care…..!
