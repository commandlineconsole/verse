HOW SAD THIS WORLD OF BEAUTY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
How sad this world of beauty might have been
How sad the leaves that do not know the beauty of their own green names
How sad the sound of sadness in its sinking down
How sad when no real sadness makes sadness so real
How sad and less than glad are we all
Savoring our own sadness-
Let it go away
Let it play elsewhere
Let joy and laughter make sadness a forgotten moment
Let joy and laughter even be our song to ourselves
Let's try
A new world is waiting for those capable of writing and listening to a poem
That has not a single note of sadness left in it.
