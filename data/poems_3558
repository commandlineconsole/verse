I WROTE
I wrote
And rewrote
The poem
As it was concerning them
What did it compose?
Trust to repose?
Confidence to instill
I was not sure still
Many write about me
That my verses are not free
Lack some depth with error
I take it as honor
At least they try to pick
Scold me with stick
I smile and put more thrust
As I see it with more trust
No one may that much lucky
As I am with no worry
Readers come out with bold comments
I have no regret at this moment
How many poems a day?
Nothing comes in my way
I write, write and write
It increases power to fight
I shall continue to strive
And put more thrust to revive
Some articles with new trend
At least it may bring me close to them as friend
