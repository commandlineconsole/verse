GLOWING EMBERS
Within the glowing embers
of a fire going to sleep,
I see a future of happiness
born out of sadness
that had lingered too long.
The myriad tentacles of sadness
that tried to strangle happiness
are beginning to fall away
allowing the sun to rise
on a brand new life and day.
Yesterdays fears are disappearing,
replaced with future hope.
The wounds and scars of defeat
are all beginning to heal,
and all this I see in the glowing embers
of a fire going to sleep.
