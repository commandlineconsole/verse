WORD POWER
Everyone was apprehensive
About what he would utter
This was the day conclusive
People will generally flatter
His name was now announced
To state some of his few words
People present were surprised
He chose the pleasant words
He apparently complimented
In due polite and calm manner
People knew him discontented
Each word chosen was clever
He surprised everyone for sure
Also had won everyoneâ€™s heart
Words too open to interpret there
To express in words not so hard!
