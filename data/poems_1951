SWEET SURPRISE
What a sweet surprise
When I first looked into your eyes
I see your smiling face
And I know without a doubt you fell from grace
Your love is like a trophy I want to show the world
And make them jealous that I have this beautiful girl
I have only known you a short time
But I hope this love last my life line
I'm hanging on to you forever
Because when we're together everything is better
A true friend, a best friend
A friend I hope to have until the end
Such a woman, you've stole my heart
I'd try to explain but I don't know where to start
Oh I look into your eyes
And recieve such a sweet surprise
