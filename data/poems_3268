SHATTERED HEART
Walking alone in the path of darkness
Don't know where it ends
Keeping your memories in my heart
Moving inside into the world of sorrowfulness.
I shouted, cried aloud but no one to hear
Only cats and dogs were barking and standing there.
Once I feared of darkness
Now its the only friend for my spareness.
Hope to see the light one day
where I will make my own world
And if I wish I could remove all the sorrow
and also if I could, then happiness will I borrow.
Now I've to go my friend
But don't forget the world with this new trend
where you will find many shattered heart
but request you all don't heart the hurt.
