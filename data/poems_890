SON
I was happy with a smile
But that was life’s shortest mile
And I’ve laid my joy to rest in a pile
For I’m not sure how long; at least awhile
Now it rests.
Once you were a boy
As small and fragile as a toy
But oh, you brought me joy
You were my boy for awhile
Now you rest.
My father cared for my lawn
But for many years now, he’s been gone
He felt joy and pride in his John
That was my name for awhile
Now he rests.
You waned into the blue
As down fell the night’s cold dew
And my joy did fall with you
I held you close for awhile
Now you rest.
You were my boy for awhile
Perfect as only God could make
You are my son
You are my joy.
