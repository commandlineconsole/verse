SUB
Master to a sub
With beauty beyond compare
With elegance and grace
In play a theatrical flare
Loyalty and obedience
At everything we do
Exploring realms of pleasure
With a passion o so true
Letting me control her world
In every single way
Giving herself totally
To the erotic sway
Bound by ropes for pleasure
She would never fight
Enjoying the sparks
In the orgasms light
She can take all I give
And still cry out for more
Tied across the bed
Bound on the floor
In red tight corset
She looks so fine
My last words are
She is MINE
