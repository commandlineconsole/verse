MY FEELINGS ARE ALWAYS HURT
Why is life so blank for me that it just treats me like a complete waste of time? To care for me nobody ever wants to. Fine, just go away because I also do not even care anymore. My love and true feelings of care is always misunderstood. You want to hate me, go ahead do it even more. Loss is yours because you just lost someone who unconditionally cared about you.
