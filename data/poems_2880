YOUR CELL
Your eyes read out the sadness
That tortures your soul
The love inside you
Tears out of your body
No one had ever loved me as you
Such passion and kindness you have
Too much
The love you have for me
Is your prison
Locking you into a sentence of forever
Loving me
I only hope I can give you the key
To let you out of your sadness
And into our love.
