MY FEAR
I feel a fear
A replica of a fear, oh dear!
my fall seem near
A fear, oh dear!
A feeling of a fear
It lodge in my soul
Like a fear I have felt
Oh dear! , it stays
It has clouded my soul
It has rendered it foul
Oh dear!
It is a monster of a fear
The fear, oh dear
Is a replica of a fear
A fear I have felt
On the scars on my soul
Oh dear! , this fear
It leave my soul to tear
I feel a fear
Oh dear! , a fear
My fall seem near.
