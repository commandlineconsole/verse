LOVE RESURRECTION
I want to be just you and me
The music to play
To hide in a lonely place
To taste a bottle of red wine
To kiss you full of passion
Like there is no tomorrow
You are the sea, i am the wind
Touch you softly, touch you wildly
Your body dynamite alight
Your breath stops the time
Your kiss, frozen me, burning me
Your glance like magnet
We roll like the river, from bed
to walls, from tables to rugs
Like a piano melody our fingers
Touching wet body
Let it never end
Passion, eternity
To this room the death will come
And if tomorrow comes
Don't be afraid
It's a love resurrection
