STORMY EYE
Sitting up long slumber day of waves
wrapping silk caress muscled
calves in sand.
Thrusting arching of the neck shivers
pleasure rock the land.
Over head the cumulus gather in dread
they on water such
know fear.
Reaching out simple thought in head
sinking pleasure boat
all dead.
Yawning smiling sigh all spent reclines
again in sand.
