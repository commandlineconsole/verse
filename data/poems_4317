DO NOT FEAR I AM HERE
Do not fear
Do not fear
I am here
I am here.
My driver is telling me always
O my dear, go on, go on I am near.
Do no fear
Do no fear
I am controlling the world
By these two threads.
See the bull here
The bull is controlled by rope in its nose.
Do not fear
Do not fear
Inhale and exhale
It is your heaven
It is your hell .
It is you to decide
Whether to survive
Or to perish
All depend on you.
Do no fear
Do not fear
I am there
I am here.
Just hear
What is near.
