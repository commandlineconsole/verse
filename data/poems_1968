BONG
now in the field of law
surprise, surprise
i have seen his latest pic
on the train
as he was waiting for
someone
he does not recognize me
and i pretend
not knowing him
i remember those days
of police line-ups
less the smiles now
we still wear the same
anxious faces
the train arrives
he is in the embrace
of a woman
i guess, let me guess
ten years younger
that his age
the way they kiss
she is not his daughter.
