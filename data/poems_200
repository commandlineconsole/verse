LOVE FOR ALL
Love is to give and not to take,
Love mankind for heaven's sake,
Love sees neither caste nor any creed,
Love is selfless and not greed,
Love is not to harm, love is to help,
Love is his massage, rather he himself,
Love is truth, love is Sacrifice,
Hatred for mankind is the worst vice,
Love is religion, love is rhyme,
Love is reminiscence, love is  reliance,
Love the big, love the small,
Hatred for none, LOVE FOR ALL...........
