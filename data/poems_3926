UNCOMPARABLE
She cared for me
More than for herself
We all cared for self
More than for her!

She did not complain
Encouraged us to do that
She may have felt neglected
But accepted it from a brat!
Now she is lonely
Her beloved has gone
She still wants us all
Care more for us alone!

Facing all the hardships
Evading her emotions
Trying to give tranquillity
To all daughters and sons!

She knows how she cared
Also knows our own life
That’s the mother’s love
Unparallel uncomparable!
