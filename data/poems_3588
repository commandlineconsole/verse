A MORNING CHAT WITH YOU
a morning chat with you
sweet nothings
words of concern
like the simplest hello
and little talks about
anything
something that has nothing
to do with burdens
something so light
like a trivial
nonsense, a casual
conversation beside my
cup of coffee
at the veranda
on a window overlooking
the sea
with outlines of the mountains
stretching a line
on a horizon of blue and
gray
like sunshine on my shoulder
and then i dress myself
and face my own wars
out there
