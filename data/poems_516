SOFT AND TENDER
Naked bodies
locked in passionâ€™s throes,
behind closed doors,
so no one can see.
The heat of their loving,
within their embrace.
The soft and tender
murmurs that their voices make.
The passion rises,
and theirs voices adhere.
They are locked together,
two becoming one
in the heat of the passion,
which no one can feel, but them.
The steamy seductress
where loving is our fate,
now laying side by side,
arms still locked
around one another,
now that the passion is over.
