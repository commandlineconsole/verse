TRUE JOY OF LIFE
You can never reach the place of joy true
If you keep on putting off it too
For some future day of your life
And think without it you can survive
So try to be happy in whatever you do
And know that joy that is true
Is only found along life's road
If you can learn to press it's code
And know that true joy in life
Needs to be seeked 'n found in drive
In the drive of this life
Where we ar all bound to survive.
