ENDLESS SORROW
Life has two faces
happiness and sorrow
either ways make essence
of what existence truly meant
With the grace of God
we are redeemed from sin
as Jesus died on the cross
and save us from damnation
Happiness makes peace
but sorrow brings turmoil
reality on earth at present
has shown endless sorrow
