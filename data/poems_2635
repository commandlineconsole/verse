COLD INSIDE
When I’m not in love
I feel this special sadness
Inside
When I start again
To be with the man
But I need to be  a woman
So I go to another
Who makes me feel this way
And for a while it’s OK
But this sadness inside
Is still racking my heart
To the end
Of the new romance
With the man
I’m not in love
I can’t love anymore
If I know
That the man
I wish to be with
Is so close but silent and
In the deep of my heart
I’m still with him
In my dream
Lying with husband
Trying to love a new one too
Always this same
Sadness of the heart
After another cold night
Cold inside
