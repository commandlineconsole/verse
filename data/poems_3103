RED DAWN
Drowning in the sorrows of the past
The streets are scattered with limbs waiting for mend
They are here at last
The pain went all but too fast
The Blitz left us begging for a painless rend
Drowning in the sorrows of the past
We lay here like a forgotten cast
The Panzers bring horror as itâ€™s vend
They are here at last
Rising like the flag, on the mast
Of the Red Navy, they shall bring the death to end
Drowning in the sorrows of the past
The help arrives at last
Saving us from our devious friend
They are here at last
They will not be able to cast
Us away; the defense we shall send
Drowning in the sorrows of the past
They are here at last
