IF YOU REALLY LOOKED INTO MY EYES...
If you really looked into my eyes,
you'd see all the pain and all the lies.
If you really looked into my eyes,
I swear to God you'd be so surprised.
If you really looked into my eyes,
you'd be sure to see all the things I hold inside.
But, you don't really look into my eyes,
so you'll never be surprised.
You'll always be trapped by my hopeless lies,
locked forever behind my mask and my disguise.
