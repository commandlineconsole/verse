I FEAR
In this fearless world
M full of fear,
In this outgoin world
I fear….
I do not fear death
But that
They’ll beat me to pieces,
Burn me to ashes….
I do not fear of sumone,
But of losin myself to sumone….
I do not fear of the competition,
But of getting crushed in it....
Its not the fear of ne enemies,
But of my very own frends….
Its not the fear of growing older,
But of not getting to grow up….
Its not the fear of makin decisions,
But of losin myself to sumone else’s decisions….
I do not fear of books,
But of its contents....
I do not fear dreamin,
But transformin them to reality….
I do not fear learning,
But of learning the right things….
I do not fear speakin,
But of speakin the ‘truth’….
Its not that I dun have that strength,
But I fear showing it off….
Its not that I cant face the bloody world,
But I fear facing it…………………………..
