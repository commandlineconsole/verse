COLORFUL WORDS
In your way I am sending
Colorful words of fain
In your path i'm sending
Wishes and good luck's train
In your pace I am sending
Pleasures and hope
And on the road of your life
The care and love's rope
And i'm doing it all my dear
Because in my own way
I want to brighten
Your whole life's way
Because you're very special
For whom I really care
And always wish for you
Pleasure, fain and cheer.
