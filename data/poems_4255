HOURS
The hours come slowly
Each minute seems a year
For my mothers life
I do fear
Hours pass
Turning to years
Finally it's all gone
All the fear
At this time again
The time moves slowly
After all these years
It's back... my fear
After these years
I wonder to myself
What is left to fear
Finally again i know
Again the hours come slowly
Each minute seems a year
For my father's life
I do fear
