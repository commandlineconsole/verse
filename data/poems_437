I'LL SHOW MY PASSION
Come to me when,
Something's bothering you.
Come to me when you want to boo-hoo...
And I'll show my passion.
With compassion.
Come to me when,
Something's bothering you.
Come to me when you want to boo-hoo...
And I'll show my passion.
With compassion.
I'm not the one who sits around,
To put folks down like they're the clowns.
Without a passion.
Or show compassion.
I'm not the one who sits around,
To put folks down like they're the clowns.
I do show passion.
With compassion.
Come to me when,
You want to be hugged and close...
And I'll show my passion,
With compassion.
Come to me when,
You want to be hugged and close...
And I'll show my passion,
With compassion.
Give up your fears to feel,
My passion.
Give up your fears to feel,
Compassion.
Give up your fears to feel,
There's nothing that you have to prove...
Or be someone that isn't you.
Give up your fears to feel,
My passion.
Give up your fears to feel,
Compassion.
Give up your fears to feel,
There's nothing that you have to prove...
Or be someone that isn't you.
Come to me when,
You want to be hugged and close...
And I'll show my passion,
With compassion.
