SILENT JOYS
A pragmatic realist in life's short span,
He weeps to endure a long nights plan.
Morning brings a silhouette of joy,
An exotic dawn, brought on by a toy.
Many joys in life are late in coming,
Good friends that try, love in the morning.
Great joy and greif are both silent things,
Happiness is loud, proud, and strange.
The smile screams a story to the world,
Silent joys tasted in a sweet lady's pearls.
Love sees silhouetted smiles of morning,
Greif is not allowed in daylights warning.
Happy to spend to-morrow unpaired,
In silent bless, remembering your care,
Yelling silent joys that others can't hear.
