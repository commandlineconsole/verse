CRIMSON LOVE
~~~This Is A Personal Poem That Shows My Emotions Clearly, And Not Through A Shadowed Glass Of Interpretations Like My Other Musical Poems.~~~
Do you want to know what my problem is?
I'll tell you what my problem isâ€¦
I Love You. I love your name, I love your gorgeous smile,
I love the way you walk, I love your beautiful eyes,
I love the sound of your laugh, i love the way you get mad,
i love the way i dont understand you at all.
I love the way I can be having the worst day of my life and seeing you completely changes my mood.
I love how when you touch me I get weak,
I Love How I always think of you,
I Love how you talk, I Love your laugh,
I Love how you understand me,
I love how you will always be by my side,
I Love how you are your own character,
I love that you will never change,
I love how you look,
I Love how i fall in Love with you every day, over and over again;
I Love talking to you, I love being with You,
I Love how You are and what You can be;
I love the way you look at me,
I love Your hugs and kisses; I love your touch;
I Love how i miss you,
and I Love how I care so much,
I Love how your the only one i see,
I love that your the only one for me
I love how your always in my head,
I love the way you listen,
and I Love it when your happy,
and I Love the way You seem to know,
I even Love it when You dont,
I Love the time I waste with you,
I love all the times i look at You,
I Love how you're in my Dreams,
I Love the times you thought of me,
I love your eyes, your teeth,
your smile, your lips, your nose, your face,
and everything below;
But Most Of All, I Love You For You :)
I wish I could Love You more,
but impossible isnt a place i can get to alone <3
