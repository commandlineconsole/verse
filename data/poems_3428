MY BEDROOM
I have no despair
I have no anxiety
I have no concern
I have no worry
I am brave
I am heroic
I am courageous
I am fearless
Then I close my door
I begin to think...
I have despair
I have anxiety
I have concerns
I have worries
Suddenly, I fear
I stay up at night, keeping busy
I try so hard to prolong sleep
For where I sleep is an evil place
I lie in bed and plead for sleep to come
I lie in bed, horrified of what will come
I lie in bed and succumb to my thoughts
I now admit my despair
I now lay anxious
I now list my concerns
I continuously worry
I have many fears
I now see how fake it all is
There is no one there, I am alone
I finally admit, I always was alone
I have no friends, I have no life
I have no one to turn to
I have no support
They fake their smiles, and pretend all day
But I know the truth, they do not like me
I have no one to talk to
I have no one to love
I have nothing
Nothing but myself
Behind this door, I lay
I lay prisoner
Prisoner to my thoughts
There is nothing inside me
It feels so empty, I gasp for air
But I am suffocated by these truths
These truths that hold me prisoner
I want life to end, but death terrifies me
Sometimes I wish they were honest
They could just say they do not like me
They could say they don't want to talk to me
They could say I am not their friend
But every day we dance the same dance
I go about my day without despair,
Without anxiety or concern
I do not worry
Instead I am brave, and heroic
I am courageous and I am fearless
Until I close my door
Once again I begin to think
Again I plead for sleep to come
I am alone, accompanied only by tears
I have nowhere to turn,
No one to talk to
I have no one to love
And I have nothing
I cry until my body is exhausted
And then I sleep, oh so peaceful it is
I hate that room, I hate that bed
I hate going in there, for in there is hell
In there I'm so utterly lonely
In there I want to die
In there I cry
I shed silent tears, for my parents may hear
I hate being by myself
I hate my bedroom
I hate being alone
I hate her
...I miss her
