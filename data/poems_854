PAIN
What is pain?
Why when we are the happiest
We are actually the saddest
Why am I plagued to think,
Think of this sadness
Why can’t I just stay happy
Pain is when you cannot be happy
Depression sets into your mind
You make believe that your happy
You mimic the feeling of joy
When you know deep inside
Your being torn apart
Pain is when the tears wont stop
Even when you think you cannot cry another tear
They just seem to keep coming
But joy, joy is when you smile through the tears
Is joy truly real, in my mind it is
For I have found say joy
Within one person
She has made my heart melt
With every word spoken
With every verse sang
I have fallen deeper in love with my angel
My angelic being sent to me
By my saving grace
Oh! How am I blessed
Brought from the darkness of pain
To the light of joy
My love will always grow for her
Till a’ last my heart beats no longer
