SURPRISE IN JAPAN - USING CHOPSTICKS
the Japanese says
he's surprised I use
chopsticks too
I thought everybody knows Chopsticks orgiinated in China and spread around from there. So I was very surprised when several Japanese expressed surprise that I can use chopsticks. Perhaps, they are not well versed in the history of chopsticks.
