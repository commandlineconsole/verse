D-ANGER
“D” is synonymous with smile
So it brings fragrance meanwhile
Anger is altogether different in nature
It brings disaster for certain and sure
Now to smile with anger is different concept
As mother scolds child when excessively wept
Or gets tough with family members when out of control
Such (d)  anger is certainly a beautiful call
Even teachers preset rudely to students
It is not aimed at discouraging them or making any dent
It is simply meant to shape their personality
Test them to time and build fine quality
Danger spells about lurking misfortune around
Its presence is unnoticed and never found
Anger may reveal the state of total frustration
Some times out of tune or sometimes with complete relation
So many great sages and saints have dwelt at great length
Fire may burn dead body but anger may burn your live strength
You will loose common sense and disembark
People may compare your language as that of dog’s bark
Even if you are established as rude person with short temper
Still people will forgive you and not mind out burst or anger
As at heart you are very kind and care for their well being
So were the benevolent rulers praised as noble king?
If you can conquer over anger with little restrain
That will be considered as land mark and gain
As person is about to loose whole of his reputation
Only on account of being good but inconsiderate in relation
