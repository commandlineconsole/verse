MY BEAUTIFUL DELIGHT
Hey beautiful delight..  when you’re in my soul, you make me feel happiness  and my soul becomes an energy full of light.
When you are still there, you make my colors shine yellow and orange like when the sun comes out in the morning.
My ears hear that rock music that never stops playing, it just keeps starting over and over again.
My soul wont be stopped from feeling this happiness, you take me outside while its sunny and the wind touches our skin.
You make me shout at my friends “ I love you so much” like voices coming out of the sky and everyone can hear what I say so they feel same way I do.
If you still here, I would say that you’re my light and thank for make me happiness in whole time and became  a sweet girl that I never became before.
You, My beautiful delight is a light came from the dark sky like stars appeared from the dark night.
My delight light touch my laughter and make sound like bird sung in morning.
My delight touch the rose that I was holding, make its cpening slowing and shined light came out from the closing rose and my smile growing like a  angel  was holding my hands so tighter and never let it go.
You, need to be delight and open your hearts to show that you have your light and hold my hand tighter as you could.
I, need to open my heart to show that you are always my delight and  never let your hands go.
