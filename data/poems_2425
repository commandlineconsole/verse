DEAR HATE...
Dear hate...
Who am i meeting today?
Is it Fury? Rage? Pain?
im hosting Depression, anger,
and you...hate. And sadness...
She came yesturday
and she's been crying ever since.
Was it you? Making her cry?
I felt your wars inside of me,
You and anger,
Batteling ferociously, while
Depression sit's in the corner
Turning all black with his soft whispers of
'you aren't enough! ''
And Sadness sobbed
Which fueled your hate
And fueled angers anger.
Pain and Rage burst in
with a bleeding roar
Pain rests on my heart,
tired from her agony,
She bleeds through,
and, God, how it aches.
Rage joins
Yours and angers battle.
Who will rule my actions?
Who will rule my thoughts?
Who will rule my words?
You, and Depression, seem,
to have stolen my thoughts...Ruler of all.
You send Rage an Pain
to weave into my words
and anger and sadness
flow into my actions
All i hear is roaring, sobbing, agony
buzzing in my ears, words, thoughts,
and all i see when i look into the mirror
is fury swimming
in the eyes of a broken soul,
shattered and unwhole
like if i broke the mirror
watched it splinter into a million pieces,
then sent each piece to a different place,
Would they come back?
No...they would be lost forever,
With the mirror frame
Standing bare and empty,
Containing only memories of what used to be
It's wholeness is gone, and it is lost
And if some pieces did come back,
there would still be cracks,
and missing pieces...unwole.
Fixing the mirror, would be like fixing me
...impossible.
And like that frame, frames emptiness
I do to, except for my basic frame
Which is built from Pain, Depression,
Rage, anger, and you...hate.
Yours forever
