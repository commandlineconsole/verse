TO EVE: MANNERS
lets have
a day
or two
to see where it goes.
until now
all what i see
is a woman without surprises;
may be you like to keep your surprises
for the future, or
may be it is a part of a big surprise.
two days are enough for me
to turn your surprises on an off.
turning them on
is not my surprise.
turn them off will be a two days drill.
