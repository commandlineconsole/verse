FEAR
Fear of death
Fear of life
Fear of truth
Fear can bite
Fear devours
Trust at sight
Fear turns logic
Into spite
Fear even doth
Turn light to night
When it upon
Your shoulder lights
Fear twists
Fear kills
Fear is the cause
Of most world ills
Love chase fear away
When fear gone
All just peace
One Day
