WHAT WAS THAT LIE AGAIN?
I remember watching the steam of your coffee waft upwards across your face
The cup cradled in cold hands on a winter morning
The light seemed to dance around you riotous in its arrival
Unwearied after its long journey from the sun
What was that lie again?
Something about love, wasn't it
Being 'in' love with me
The meaning seems lost now
I remember the curve of your hip
How it fit my hand so well
I remember watching you sleep
And wanting to walk in your dreamscape
The mirror where I watched you prepare for your daily unveiling
Failed to display your need to move on
To find that place where you were told you belonged
Never knowing how my soul adored you
Or recognizing the place prepared for you at my side
Was it me who said it wasn't working?
I think It was, but I didn't know the consequence of that utterance
No more you and me
No more loving you
You were the most beautiful thing I ever touched
You were the most painful thing I ever touched
I think I surprised you
I know you surprised me
What was that lie again?
Something about being right back, wasn't it?
But you never came back
You never did
