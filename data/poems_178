YOUR LOVE IS PRECIOUS TO ME......
Your love is more precious than diamond
Your love is more valuable than gold
Your love is brightening my life
Your love is means so much to me
Your love is making me complete and whole
Your love is an unimaginable love to love
Your love is an unlocked door for me
Your love is a secret with my drunken love
Your love is like a sun that can melt my heart
Your love is dancing when I look at you
Your love is making body language when I touch you
Your love is feeling shyness when I am in you
Your love is so beautiful and cares for me.
