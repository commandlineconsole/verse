EACH DAY HAS COUNTLESS SMALL MOMENTS OF JOY
EACH DAY HAS COUNTLESS SMALL MOMENTS OF JOY
Each day has countless small moments of joy
Little sensations of light
Pleasures of the eyes and palate
Simple little things barely noticed-
Each day has countless small moments of joy
Life gives so much in so many little ways-
As I look out my window now the morning sun shines back at me
As if to say
“ You do not know how right you are, smiling old fool”
