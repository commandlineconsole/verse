LET US DREAM TOGETHER
Lets us come closer,
And dream together,
Dream of a world,
Which is full of joy,
Dream of a life,
Having no trace of sorrow,
Having abundance of,
Smiling faces,
And cheerful weather,
Lets us come closer,
And dream together,
Of a world where there
Is no trace of fear
Fear of bomb blast,
Fear of abduction,
Fear of a war,
Fear of any disruption
Fear of loosing someone,
Very dear and close to
The heart
Lets us come closer,
And dream together,
Of a toddler and child,
Playing in a garden,
Running after a butterfly,
And her parents while,
Looking at her,
Keep on smiling with amusement,
Their faces not showing any trace of fear.
Lets us come closer,
And dream together,
Of an old grandpa,
Who is not lonely,
Not discarded by his children,
Rather, he is laughing in full pitch,
While recollecting the nuances,
He used to make in his childhood,
And sharing his thoughts,
With his grand children.
