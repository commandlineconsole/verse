LOVING YOU
Loving you is like the deepest sin
Our hearts and minds connect within
The minute we touch is a temptation
A feeling that gives me a rushing sensation
After one tender kiss
The moment is bliss
After one gentle touch
It grows to a rush
Your skin is like honey
your lips are like wine
A mixture of passion and lust combined
Our bodies connect in strong emotion
A feeling of endless support and devotion
The passion of love
That comes from above
A moment in time
When you would be mine
