FEAR
fear,
Lord I fear to ruin any of your plans,
I can see that you are close to me since I saw your power,
You alone is mighty,
The puissant King,
Behold I saw that you are my saviour,
I've seen the present time for the future world,
I know that fear will only fake us,
Annihilate our father's authority, I know that I should be faithful to the end of time's,
For the life that we lead in fear it's not the righteous spirit,
The spirit of truth must prevail with no lie in it,
I know that in my suffering behold is a glory for God.
