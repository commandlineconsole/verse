NIGHT AND DAY
She wakes
She looks around
She feels intrusive thoughts
She stares through the window
He lay
He continues thinking
He holds nervous energy
He stares at the ceiling
Her mind
Her body lethargic
Her thoughts jump nervously
Her concerns are the morning
His psyche
His legs restless
His day lamented over
His concerns are about sleep
Day ends
Night begins
