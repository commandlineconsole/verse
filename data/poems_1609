CONJUNCTION IS SEX
She drives him insane with her sucks of his.
He loses himself, which is his pleasure.
She submits herself, which is his pleasure.
She is in the driving seat, her pleasure.
He drives her insane with his licks of hers.
She loses herself, which is her pleasure.
He submits himself, which is her pleasure.
He is in the driving seat, his pleasure.
He sinks into her and moves up and down.
She moves her pelvis to meet his charges.
She feels fullness in and sensation sweeps.
He feels tightness in and sensation sweeps.
Tension on its peak, he falls on release.
Tension on its depth, she falls on relief.
Losing to each other is the sexual bliss.
Charging and yielding are the sexual bliss.
Man is subject and woman is object.
Her responses are subject complements.
His imitative are object complements.
Sex is a conjunction joining two halves
