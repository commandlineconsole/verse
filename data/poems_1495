PAINFUL PLEASRUE I CANNOT GIVE UP!
Painful pleasure will be there forever!
Back pain is there for me;
But I cannot stop reading newspaper!
Back and neck pains are there;
But I cannot stop browsing poetry websites!
These painful pleasures I cannot give up;
For, we are all destined to live with them!
It is said 'no pain, no gain! ' It's true!
When we are happy we forget to thank God;
When we are in troubles only we think of God!
That is why difficulties, troubles and pains are there
And to give relief joy, luck and pleasure are there!
So, pain and pleasure together have to be enjoyed ever
And no man can escape from this destiny to enjoy this pleasure!
