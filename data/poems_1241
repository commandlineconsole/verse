YESTER NIGHT WHEN THE WIND BLEW....
Yester night
to my delight
I saw the sky
just flying....
as the wind blew
it started to drew
up its clouds
and started to roads
At first
amazed I felt
that my head reels
since above sky
appeared to fly
Oh! it was fantasy
teasing me lazy
wind was carrying
the cloud bags
like the cotton balls
burst open frisked by calls.
it is a simple sight
yet, it appealed to delight
I wondered and wondered
just amazed uncentered...........
