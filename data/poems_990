TO BEHOLD THE DREAM
Living in darkness
Seeing only pain
Need driving your every sense
Everything making me insane
But there was always one thing
Shining like eternal grace
Saving my damned soul
for but a moment
I can see peace and joy
In a split second
I am free
But the moment passes
And i return
Back to the dreary world
Of which i live
Your happiness gone
My joy gone  with it
Someday that Joy will be mine one day
To hold and enjoy
To be mine forever
A wonderful dream to behold
