THE ART OF PASSION | ART IN A POEM / LYRICS
Passion is no fashion it’s an art
You and I got to have a heart to heart
A secret from me through the whispers
All you got to do is observe
Put feet to your dreams and send them walking
Stuff worries in a sack and send them packing
Turn your mind on and get to thinking
What are you doing with the word living
Put stubborn on your side and win him over
Make him invisible put him on your shoulder
Paint a picture in your mind don’t leave any colors behind
It’s the road you got to take, make no mistake
You’ll be unstoppable, untouchable,
Something that’s unbreakable
Fashionable, beautiful
Something that’s inflammable
Give it your own signature,
Customize your path
Leave your mark, your design
Never leaving passion lonely or behind
And remember passion is no fashion it’s an art
No one stands in the way of heart
Show the world what you’ve got
All it takes is a stubborn spark
You’ll be unstoppable, untouchable,
Something that’s unbreakable
Fashionable, beautiful
Something that’s inflammable
Freedom to surrender to all your dreams
Cause passion in no fashion it an art
