WHY
why did you leave me?
was i not good enough?
did i do something wrong?
was there someone better?
am i that horrible?
i don't care why you left.
i  don't care if i wasn't good enough.
i don't care if i did something wrong.
i don't care if there was someone else.
i don't care what you think.
i am through with you and your lies.
i could care less if you came back.
i forgive you but i don't want you.
i'll leave if you came again.
i just don't care anymore.
