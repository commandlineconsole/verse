I CARE
You cared for me when I was lost,
You cared for me regardless the cost,
When I was flailing trying to live,
You gave me hope, allowed me to live.
I care for you for all you have done,
I care for you, because I have won.
My life has changed and it is better,
I will love you my wife for  ever.
