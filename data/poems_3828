CARE FOR THY SOUL AS THING OF GREATEST PRICE
Care for thy soul as thing of greatest price,
Devoid of guilt, abhorring sin and vice,
Care for it so as by thy retchless train
It be not brought to taste eternal pain.
To vanquish pride but comely clothing take;
Care so, I say, the flesh to feed and clothe
That thou harm not thy soul and body both.
Care for the world to do thy body right;
Seek not to oppress the weak by wrongful might;
Care to dispend according to thy store,
And in like sort be mindful of the poor.
Care for thy soul, as for thy chiefest stay;
Care for the world for body's help alway;
Care in such sort that thou be sure of this:
Care keep thee not from heaven and heavenly bliss.
