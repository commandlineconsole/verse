WIDE EYES OF LOVE (FROM LULLABIES)
Wide eyes of love so tenderly in mood
Like morning blue sky and the purest day
Each multiplying universe it has hued
And given its light to strengthen its play
The fiery delights from extinguished flame
That throbs from its desire in to new height
Never exact replica of the same
Of each its comportment and harvest flight
The earth you are so handful of delights
With longings of the moon and flaring blaze
Like colors of pale stars in the outlying
Universe weaving of hidden taillights
Those dazzling lurch of restless around lays
That our dreams to the distances are eyeing
