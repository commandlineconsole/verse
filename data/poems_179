*I LOVE YOU IN THE MORNING*
I love you in the morning
I love you in the night
I love you when I see you
I love you when you are out of sight
I love you when it's raining
I love you when it's dry
I love you when you're laughing
I love you when you cry
I love you in the winter
I love you in the spring
I love you you're humming
I love you when you sing
I love you when you kiss me
I love you more than more
I love you a million simply every single day
I love you so much I simply can't keep up the score
