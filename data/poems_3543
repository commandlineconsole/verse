WHEN STOCKS ARE APLENTY
When sources were stretched
by Chinese demand,
getting love over quick
was a major concern
of the French perfume firm.
'Poetry, ' they affirmed,
'belongs in a hearse.'
Into this milieu arose a great poet
pleading love as the cause of his verse.
'Instead of a sentence, '
they said,
'we'll pay you to write in silence.
You can say what you like
and release it when stocks are aplenty,
when we can sell an ounce
for a hundred and twenty.'
