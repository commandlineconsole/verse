TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.
To whom it may concern
the drip of bloody finger tips.
halts, impetuously, tousled by the wind
and the slip from my bloody lips
is a cause for me, to learn.
Turmoil is dangerously flattering.
The red eyes, sporting her absurd disguise
oh!  the pleading eyes, overwhelms- my despise
I do believe it can go wrong.
The truth hides.
It slides stealthly in the shadows on the ground,
fast, expeditious it flows with leaps and bounds.
Yet lies are not shy, how the swoop how they fly
in the air.
To ease yet draw and vellicate my despair
Hope floats, even,
never snagging ground
though unrestrained it screaches, begs
it will  be found.
to whom it may concern
hope is fragile
I have learned.
