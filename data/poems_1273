LOVERS LIGHT
take my hand
and in this full moon light
climb the hill in this lovers light
and with each love light step
we'll gain its height
and gaze upon the moons delight
and there silhouetted by the moon
each a tear of love will cry
and take them from each others eye
and on a leaf from the ancient oak
place those two tears of moonstone blue
and bury deep under an irish yew
and when next the moon is full
go by that lovers orb above
and uncover those tears of love
if they have bonded in crystaline delight
this is meant of me and you
that our love is surely true
