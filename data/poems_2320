FORGIVENESS..
it is hard to forgive those people
who let you feel anger, pain
and discomfort...
it is the feeling or thing that you
can feel when your anger, pain
and discomfort were gone if you
have overcome them already....
It is a voice in your inner part of
your heart and soul that will help you
overcome those anger, pain and
discomfort....
No matter hard it is to give,
there is still a part of you that can help
make you easy to give to those people...
