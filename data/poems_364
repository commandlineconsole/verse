PASSION
Passion kills
for greed and jealousy
Passion thrills
When love is there
Passion fills
the heart, that's fair
Passion chills
when love's not there
Passion makes ill
when poisons flare
Passion is still
pain where you're not there.
Passion is Life
I totally agree
Passion is strive
for what we believe
Passion will make
us give our all
Have Passion don't crawl
Be passionate, stand tall.ï»¿
