A WISHFUL TOUCH...
A wishful touch, soft and tender.
Then a whisper, full of desire
A sudden gasp of sweet surrender
As passion fuels the fire
No words spoken between them
No promises to be kept
No lies being told tonight
No looking back - no regret
Longing to hold each other
Such precious little time
Both vowed to another
Being lonely their only crime
The softness of your lips, whole
As they slide over mine
Taste like honey to my soul
As they take me back in time
Oh, the fire of your touch
Like hot silk on your tender breasts
The passion I crave so much
As I taste the nectar of your kiss
A Slowly drumming melody in my heart
Your skin like a river of light
My moan of pleasure as you start
Ecstasy I'd never fight
A lovers tune dances up my spine
As the shadow of my embrace
Slides across your thighs
Ohhh sooo slowly the pace
Our hearts mingled in rapture
The torture of passion so sweet
The affection of a thousand years
As at least we meet
Tomorrow maybe bringing sorrow
A brief moment of shame
With the memory of this one night
A release from passion's flames.
