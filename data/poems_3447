DESPITE BEING
Learn and turn
Pages of concern
Burn and add
But remain no sad
If seasons can change
Why not we manage?
Stay cool in spring
And wait for autumn to bring
How earth waits for monsoon
Even though it is not coming soon
Yet we prepare and stare at sky
The birds too are ready to fly
Wait for good to happen
Even if it is not expected all of sudden
The hope should not die out
We need to concern but must talk about
Earth develops cracks
Enough to frighten with stake
Yet good change is brought about
After rain has completely lashed out
Take it lightly
Handle it aptly
Life is precious
It must go on continuous
Sing like birds
Look happy and surge ahead
The change must be well read
Else despite being alive, you are dead
