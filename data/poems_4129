I FEAR NOT
I fear not the beetles in my beans
I fear not the demons in my dreams
I fear not the pythons in my pitch
I fear not the vamp of vampires
Even at the zenith of everest
I eat my yam without fears
At the temple of death
I walk in the lightest heart
In the middle of the wildest night
I am confident like a child
In mothers embrace
Of what reason should i be
When life itself is afraid
And fear, much more afraid
If all edges would seek my blood
They might have it within pint
But I know for sure
I would rise again
Into a world without fear
