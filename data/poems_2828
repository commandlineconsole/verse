NO WAY OUT
I once had a life,
A life full of dreams,
That one tragic day destroy me,
Made the person I am today,
I tried to run,
I tried to hide,
But there is no way out of the mess I have caused,
This pain,
This misery I caused won’t fade away,
I tried to wipe away my tears,
Show my dignity,
Show that there is no reason to be afraid,
Yet I run,
Run to the highest mountain top,
I try so hard not to show my sadness,
This sadness won’t go away,
There is no way, no how, no reason for me to run.
