TOTAL CONFUSION
You used to care
Now you make me cry
I lay around at night
And I wonder why
Why did you change after all this time?
You used to care but now you make me cry
It's this total confusion in my head
These emotions inside me wont let me rest
There's just total confusion in my head
But I can't stay with you if I wanne be my best
I've been with you so long it's hard to say goodbye
But I know you aren't good for me and you make me cry
You used to care now you make me cry
I lay around at night and I wonder why
Why did you change after all this time?
You used to care and now you make me cry
You'll be mad I left
and you'll hurt me some more
So I guess I'll stay here lonely
On this cold hard floor
You used to care now you make me cry
I lay around at night and I wonder why
Why did you change after all this time?
You used to care and now you make me cry
