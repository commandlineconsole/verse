MY DARKEST FEAR
My greatest
And darkest fear
That I have
Can never appear.
For the fear I have
Is that I will harm
Those whom I love
And care deeply for.
I fear I will lose
Those closest to me
By causing them pain
That is stronger than me.
This fear of mine
Is the one thing
In my life
That I won't let happen.
So I know that I must
Keep fighting and fighting
And never give in
To my darkest fear.
