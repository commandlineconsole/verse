JEALOUSY
Jealousy,
it's nothing but trouble,
causes pain and sorrows,
makes friends,
into enemies.
...
Biggest mistake,
that you'll ever make,
is to become jealous.
...
Jealousy,
harms friendships,
makes them break,
and decease,
gone and left you alone,
no more forever friend.
...
No one to take all the pain, sorrow and hurt away,
no love or care from a forever friend,
if you let yourself fall into,
jealousy.
