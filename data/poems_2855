= TEN =
Perfect relationship doesn't exists
Hatred comes along
I hate how I felt
Leaving me with betrayal
I hate how I hurt
Planning to escape the feeling inside
Crazy things we did
And fighting for our love
Suddenly fades away
Enduring the pain and sadness
Sober every moment
Praying hard to recover
I hate how I was so stupid
Reality really bites
I hate that I don't understand
That it's totally over
Unending sadness now exists
