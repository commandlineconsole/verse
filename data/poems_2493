OUR FUTURE
A child born with hope, so full of love
Qualities given from above
They are born so innocent, so pure
But born to a world increasingly obscure
It is us that teaches them anger rage and hate
For it is us that controls their fate
We raise them into a world of war
Now we must stand together saying not today not anymore
They are the future they must lead the way
If we learn from them the love the innocents they will bring a brighter day
To them a world of peace and harmony we owe
The anger the hatred has got to go
We should raise them in a world of peace and joy
Remember they are our baby girl our baby boy
