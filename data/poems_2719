GLAD TO SPREAD THEIR SADNESS
It's too bad some folks stay emphatically mad.
And insist with inciting that others fight their battles.
It's too bad that people like this exist.
And sad it is they seek to solicit,
Others to assist.
From early morn until the Sun begins to set.
It's too bad some folks stay emphatically mad.
With a riding to stay glued and stuck to these saddles.
It's sad it is people like this can inflict their sickness.
And glad to spread their sadness.
Like raiders of hearts attacking happiness that starts.
And glad to spread their sadness.
On negative missions as if proud of it.
And glad to spread their sadness.
Enjoy they do these misfits that sit.
And glad to spread their sadness.
With a ripping apart anything that benefits.
They are glad to spread their sadness.
And glad to have their actions established.
With a riding to stay glued and stuck to these saddles.
They are glad to spread their sadness.
Like raiders of hearts attacking happiness that starts.
With a ripping apart anything that benefits,
So glad they are to have their actions established...
Are the people like this inflicting their sickness.
On 'Conflicts', 'Divisions' and 'Tensions' they sit,
Like raiders of hearts attacking all happiness.
With negative missions as if proud of it.
On 'Conflicts', on 'Divisions' and on 'Tensions' they sit,
Are the people like this inflicting their sickness.
And...
Glad to spread their sadness.
