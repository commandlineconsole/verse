SACRIFICING DECISION
The word of man
The truth
Passions of flesh
The consequences of judgement

The blood that was shed for us.
Yet how can I deny him
For just one night
For the passion of love
The sensation of pleasure

Is it wrong to love like this?
Yet I can't have the strength to stop it
The strength to decide.
To follow what is right by him
Give me the strength to know.
God help me!
