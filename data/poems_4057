FEAR
Fear is something in the corner of the room,
Fear is when something was once good and now has turned,
Fear is life, Fear is death,
Fear is letting go of you're small childs hands,
Fear is losing, Fear is winning,
Fear is light, Fear is the dark,
Fear is the line we must cross to be heard,
Fear is nothing without the thoughts of being Real.
