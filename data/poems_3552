ONE SECRET FROM DEATH
To you..please
if you are...
concerned,
My dark room,
i can never escape
even in death...
My secrets are not that bad..
some wrong some sad...
i understand it's to bad for us...
Upon my brow..
i wear a crown undesired by me..
at least i would think for peeing in a shoe..
Locked in a room with only darkness..
no light to see not even to pee..
i use my shoe.
Parents off in city for fun..
they are young...
two of us locked in the room..
of shame...we blame us..not them..
they are mommy and daddy...
no wrong can they do..glaring..
mornings come..always..
mom would open the door..
rude from sleep and scream at us..
for peeing in those shoes..
even in death i am afraid...
i will be woken up from my sleep.
