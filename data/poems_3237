ALL I NEED
Where ever I turn,
What ever I do,
Who ever I meet,
I only hear words,
Words of sorrow, trouble and worries.
Sorrows that fill the heart,
Trouble that hinders progress,
Worries that sink to grave.
Will this not change?
For all I need is,
Peace of mind,
That inward silence.
If it happens not now,
My heart shall progress to grave.
