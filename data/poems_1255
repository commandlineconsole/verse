DON'T DELIGHT ME ANYMORE
Cynic smile for a while
Bestows life to beguile
But the chase for overblown costume
Tastes good, with misplaced chastity
While I confess, Love doesn't be light me anymore
Pair of legs, brushed up yet haggard cheeks
Don’t delight me anymore
With out caring for dirty grounds
Emptied skies by any means
Hovering long with all for whole
But no one sees my bleeding wounds
Not fond of existent solitude
In stained eyes attitudes
Let me try with soul and heart
To avoid mechanized affection
An offshoot of a morbid love
for mercantile admiration
Don’t delight me anymore
