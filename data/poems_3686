WHY?
why do i care if he calls me?
Why do i care if he is mad at me?
Why do i care if he wants me back or not?
Why do i care at all?
i care if he calls because i miss his voice,
i care if he is mad because i cant stand the distance,
i care if he wants me because i still want him,
i care becuse i love him.
