FOR A MAN! !
It's true
That I was created
Just for you
To melt between your arm
To make you smile in charm
So, don't be surprised when
I fight for you
Coz you're ma world
& I can't let it go
Don't be surprised when
You see ma fingers as a claw
Or see my red blood
Turns to be blue
Don't be surprised when
You see ma rose just a thrown
Or my kind heart is a little devil grown
Don't be surprised if you feel
My hug is as a jail
Or if I would be a murderer
When I see you with another girl
Don't be surprised if
You see ma kind look is a shooter look
Or you see yourself in every
Single paper of ma book
If it's hard for you to believe
That you are the air I always breath
Know that I was always dreaming of u
Before I came to earth or even grow
I wrote your name on the stars
With ma blood
& I would bend on my knees for
You after god
It's a matter of being alive or dead
To be with u and to carry your kid
You are my case that I can never lose
So, please accept me as a killing rose
