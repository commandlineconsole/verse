EMOTIONS WALK
Sorrow took the bus
to town and met
Happy at the square
but Happy was too busy
so Sorrow went on
vacation with Solitude
who though a bit crazy
was quite a listener, dude
Sorrow decided to change
his name and so became
Relieved, Relieved ran
a marathon with Happy
hare, and Sorrow the
tortoise like snail, Relieved
was not in the perpetual
competition between the
Tortoise and the Hare
and reflected the scenery
better to the spectators there
