'SORROW'
“Sorrow”
I have so much sorrow
I really don’t care if there’ll be a tomorrow
I’m all alone in this abnormal world
I can’t see my life ahead because it’s such a blur
My sorrow is something normal in my life
I don’t care if I’ll be a wife
I love my life but, I hate my life
I don’t care about what I do
I don’t care about trying something new
My whole life is based on sorrow
I never think about happiness
It’s all because I can do nothing else but stress
I hate the fact that my life is such a mess
Sorrow
I hate that word! !
