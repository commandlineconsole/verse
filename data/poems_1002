RELISH SMALL PLEASURES
Relish small pleasures
As they are the treasure
That season our lives
With joy that survive
And show us new hopes
And new laws to cope
With troubles of life
That do survive
For life is a trip
Whose journey as a grip
To hold joy and sorrow
And dull and bright tomorrow
So its good for us all
To enjoy all big and small
Joy and life's pleasure
As they are great treasures.
