WORRY’S ADDED BURDENS
Worry can be debilitating my friend, as you worry around every bend,
Each bend and valley in the road, will put on you an unbearable load,
A load we’re not meant to bear, as God wants every burden and care,
Each and every one cast off to Him, lest we become worried and sin.
Worry will turn concern into fear, making cloudy what’s just not clear,
Focusing on what we just don’t know, while fear within starts to grow,
So as that fear begins to fill a heart, all peace within seems to depart,
And all the promises from The Lord, through sinful worry, go ignored.
Worry can also lead to bitterness, moving one’s heart to unrighteous,
Causing a heart strife, deep within, because of the very nature of sin,
And if not checked will only wrought, sinful action of a bitter thought,
Actions, that will do nothing friend, to ease your concerns in the end.
Anger then begins to its play apart, if bitterness is allowed in a heart,
And anger only causes more pain, as you find worry affords no gain,
You will not gain, but simply fall back, as that devil, strives to attack,
Using something pure as concern; causing bitterness in you to churn.
Worry will never help you at all, but only cause you to stumble or fall,
From that very firm and solid place, where you’re reassured by grace,
If you take your eyes off of Christ, to bear alone the cares of this life,
Losing the very God given peace, which through all shall never cease.
