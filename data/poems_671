HEART OF A POET
Many woman said they don't like a poet
For they usually don't mean what they said
For they have a tongue with magical wand
That can elicit the gentle wind's command.
But not all poet are born like that I said
For their heart speak passion's they had
About anything with their conscience mild
In their love to delight  mind of troubled child.
The heart of a poet radiates in many ways
To tingle the mind and soul to think wise
With the thoughts and magics of their pen
With the  passion of their heart from heaven.
