THE OCEANS BEATING THEIR HEARTS
Anything that means anything
To me
Is a sadness- and, yes, the serpent
Echoes
Up in the apple tree, telling truths
I took for sadness:
While in the airplanes pass
They roar
Like lions of sadness who are also
Personified:
Coming down, doing jumping jacks
Like fireworks dying
In the cloud banks, showing off
Some lights
And some heel- but going down:
Magnifying everything that appears at sea
Level
And the oceans beating their hearts
And say so many things that we are never
Meant to hear.
