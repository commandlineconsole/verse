I AM BLESS BEYOND THE CURSE
I am trading my sorrows
I am trading my shames
I am laying them down for Joy.
I am trading my Sickness
I am trading my Pain.
I am pressed but not abandoned,
stuck down but not destroyed.
The curse for your promise will endure.
That your Joys gonna be my Strength!
You lift the needly from the ashes
and seat them high the princes
you give the barren Woman healing
She'll dance for Joy like the Mother of Children.
