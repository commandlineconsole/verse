PHANTOMS OF DELIGHT
Skin shivers with the whispers of the coming night
Behind trees and shadows emerge phantoms of delight
They sing the pleasures of touch and taste
The rhythm and smells of love so chaste
Clouds dance to the charm of the waves
Ideas take flight for hearts to misbehave
Stars explode like fireworks filling the heavens with light
The atmosphere is pregnant from the phantoms of delight
There are no distractions of space or time
Only a sweet melody that saturates the mind
Veins beat a dramatic intense chorus
Even the wind can not help but to adore us
Entranced by our touch mesmerized by our plight
We waltz through the air with these phantoms of delight
Snug in our cocoon that we have made
The two of us celebrating the foundations we have laid
Secured by anchors and rudders that keep us on course
Naturally swaying and drunk from loveâ€™s force
Our feet on the ground yet our souls take flight
Here enjoying the company of these phantoms of delight
