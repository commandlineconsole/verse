TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
You don't know me
and those who do
act like they don't
It's ok, this is life
We go through ups and downs
Everyday, we learn
Everyday, we meet new people
To whom it may concern
The stars shine for why?
The sun goes to sleep
I wake up to repeat
Showcasing, who I am
in a way that stands out
Beautiful people are vicious
What's all that about
Ugly people maintain manners
What's all that about
We try to impress every human we can
To whom it may concern
I'll try to make you a fan.
