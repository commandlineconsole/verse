SCARED YET FEARED
Fear.
Fear of being lonely.
Fear of letting someone past.
Fear of getting too close.
Fear of being hurt.
Fear of letting go.
Fear of hurting him.
Fear of not one but two.
Fear of loosing me.
Fear of loosing you.
Fear of the pain.
Fear of the love.
Fear of your kiss.
Fear of your hugs.
Fear of my life.
Fear of yours.
scared. yet Feared
