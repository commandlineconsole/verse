*        BIRTH CONTROL LOGIC
Birth control is not anti-self-indulgence
not even depriving the
supreme gift of pleasure
Yes God allows people
to multiply on earth
Yet same God instructs
same people to subdue
and take control the multiplied population
Human needs need controllership
to take control is not merely
to control, to rule over populace.
to take control is taking control
the ultimate birth-making pleasure
to subdue perilous ballooning population
Birth control therefore is not
anti-self-indulgence
rather a noble submission
to the Creator who need no more
creation multiplacation
