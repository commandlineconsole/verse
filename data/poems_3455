SHE WALKS THROUGH THE NIGHT
She walks through the streets
In the dead of night
Without a concern
About who she might meet.
She walks right by
The most unsavory characters
Wishing them well
Without a care in the world.
She’s not afraid
Of what she might face
For the people in the night
Have only watched over her.
Most would be concerned
With the path that she takes
But she has no fear
She has seen it all before.
She wanders along
Even though she doesn’t belong
In hopes of finding
What she has lost.
She performs this ritual
Each and every night
She’s not even aware
Of what she’s been doing.
If she only knew
What she did every night
But she always returns
And wakes up in her bed.
