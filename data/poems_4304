DANCING WITH FEAR
Tis very hard to face what is frightening
But call to fears to dance.
When you face fear itself
It is no where to be found.
Fear can never survive total
Meeting with consciousness.
When it arises to the surface,
The implulse is to overcome.
Invite fear when it comes,
Fear is only powerful when escaping.
So call to fear,
Where are you? Open the door and let it in.
Fear can lead to isolation and separation,
So just call out 'Dance with me! '
Fear no longer exists,
and we are free.
