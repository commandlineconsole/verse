MAILBOX SURPRISE
I just put-up a new larger mailbox,
one with a little flag on top.
It's not that I'm expecting more letters,
It's the junk-mail that will not stop. I know there will be more tomorrow,
I'd be surprised if I was wrong.
If it did slacken a little bit,
It wouldn't be for long. Oh! The mailman must have just gone by,
I see the little flag is still dancing.
I suppose it's more pre-approved credit card forms,
Or catalogs with easy financing. So, I looked in the mailbox,
In fact I looked twice,
Surprise! No junk-mail today,
Now isn't that nice.
