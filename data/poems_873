JOURNEY TO JOY
Joy isnâ€™t what money can buy
or what you can make.
It is a journey.
A journey to find true joy within yourself,
and pursue happiness.
Joy is where the oceans roar,
where the seagulls screech,
where the children explore.
At the beach,
where the sun is bright,
When the day turns to night.
The joy is boundless within yourself
Keep it safe and hold it tight,
With all your might.
That is where you can find joy!
