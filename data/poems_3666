ALMOST CAREFREE
I don’t care that you feel guilty
About the way you broke it off
I don’t care if you’re sorry
Sorry could never be enough
I don’t care about my feelings
I don’t care that I got hurt
I don’t care if you cut my throat and leave me in the dirt
I don’t care what happens next
Nothing seems worth the time
I don’t care if I don’t have sex
Or drink, or sleep, or dine
I don’t care that I upset you
When I called you whore
I only care that you don’t care no more.
