UNWAVERING FEAR
Nothing seems wrong
All is right
Perfect as can be
But in an instant
Fast yet slow
Lond but short
Everthing changes
Nothing's the same
Everything's gone wrong
All happiness and perfection gone
Like a candlelight blown out
Like the petals of a flower in a strong wind
Unwavering fear
Enters our body
Consumes the heart in a suffocating asthma
Unwavering fear
Makes your actions wrong
For your brain is gone
Unwavering fear
Makes you think things
Negatively and sourly
Predictions of the future
Once so beautiful and happy
Now full of horror and despair
Unwavering fear
Makes sleep impossible
For days on end
Unwavering fear
A suicide in the making
Just waiting for the final push
Unwavering fear
Heartache and sorrow
Shall be my last feelings
Before I take my own life
All thanks to
Unwavering fear
