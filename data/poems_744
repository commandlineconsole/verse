JOY
Bursting brightness inside,
A bright light I try to hide,
I hope no one is looking at me,
a good book a ice cream a found key,
Thats what joy means to me
They party crashers can't crash me,
I have more joy then ever will be,
I have no money, no car, no sir ree,
But i have joy i shout out in glee,
I have joy so deal with me
And even if you kick,
Bight, scratch, fight, turn off the lights,
Tell me I'm dead, chop off my head,
Tell me I'm  doomed, shoot down the moon,
I have joy and that will always be.
