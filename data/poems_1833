DUSTBIN OF SURPRISES!
Everything comes in a packages of surprises...
May be a marriage, divorce, birth as well as death.
Every minute is a surprise..
Todays surprises are not pleasant ones
They are quiet shocking..
Todays dustbins are full of surprises!
Today everything is a dust....
So it goes into bin.
Used empty cups
Used relationships
In todays life
Not startled
To see them in garbage bin.
Its no longer surprise that
Which relationship is going to be dusted
And thrown into the bin.
Baby with heart beats in the heap
Of broken glasses, poisons
Left to die to become a prey of stray dogs
Ants eating the softy flesh of living cutie.
What more can be the worst surprise!
Be ready for surprises...
Live as if you have never lived today like before.
Cry and cry until u laugh thinking it was funny!
Finding happiness in small things is a must.
So that surprises wont be shocking you.
Never dream
such a dream
which will remain a dream!
Today even Happiness is a dream!
Never let your dream go into the bin.
When life can give so many surprises
Why not the dustbin!
