TREAT IT WELL, SWEET LOVER
Breathe me in, my precious
Swim free beneath my skin
Hold tight the reigns of passion
Our hearts forever kin
Reach in and kiss my soul, sweet love
Offer yours upon my tongue
I long to sip in twilights' bliss
The taste of brine and bone
Lay peace upon my shoulders, sweet
Accept my hand with grace
Together we will meld as one
The lines of doubt erased
I close my eyes, fair angel
So that I may breathe you too
I offer just my heart, my soul
Our flame, still burning true
Listen for my whispers, love
My secrets spilt with dawn
A wind of warm temptations
For dreams to feed upon
Breathe in; breathe out, this burning need
Accept us as a whole
The portrait of our passions
Is colored by our souls
Let us be as one, my flame
To quiver b'neath the sun
Let go the chains that bind you
Our inhibitions be undone
I offer just myself, sweetheart
Wield me as you will
Please take care, my darling
Else the passion spills

I am but yours to conquer
My soul lies at your feet
Treat it well, sweet lover
And yours, I'm sure to be
I'll only know of sorrow, love
If silence claims your song
So sing, sing sweet, my passion
Sing sweetâ€¦forever long
