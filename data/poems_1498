TO YOU, UNTIL MY LAST BREATH.
When I have told that I respected you,
The pleasure I derived was bearable,
When I have told that I admired you,
The pleasure I acquired was measurable,
When I have told that I appreciated you,
The pleasure I obtained was enviable,
When I have told that I loved you,
The pleasure I felt was unbearable,
The words can't express how to write it,
The weighing scales have nothing to measure it,
The sun and the moon have become opaque for a while,
The swirling wind staggers and stands still for many minutes,
The earth lets her grip below my feet to let me afloat,
The pleasure, I had was unbearable and immeasurable,
When I tell my love to you,
When I tell my love to you,
When I tell my love to you,
When I tell my love to you,
Thai Manne!
