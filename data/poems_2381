FIRE
Flicker and burn, writhe and turn.
I see flames lick and lash at the red hot ground.
Red-hot heat sears all in it's path,
Embers and ashes lay all around.
Fear or anger
Initiate the fire that rages and burns
Revolving around one's soul,
Evolving into the forest fire that, in one person, churns.
Fire, flames of anger,
In love, a fire in your heart?
Relive all those fiery moments.
Everyone has a deep fire in them.
Whether it be love or anger, a fire burns inside you. Let that fire continue to rage, accept love and anger for the false insecurities there are.
Fire.
