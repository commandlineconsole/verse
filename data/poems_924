A DAY OF JOY
A day of joy and a day of fun
A playful day under the shining sun
Is what I really wish for you
With tons of joy all honest and true
Dear friend i wish may with God's love
Your whole life be decorated with the curve
Of laugh and fain, fun and smile
And many more joy for miles
Because you're a friend who is nice
Who do nice things without thinking twice
For whom everyone really wishes
A very happy day under God's bliss.
Happy Birthday Saima
