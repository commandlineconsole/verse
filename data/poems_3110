SORROW D'CREES
Sorrow D'Crees
By: Adam M. Snow
The night will be torn in twos,
And days stripped away,
And hearts shattered a thousand times,
By the alleviant of sorrow d'crees.
To wake and be no morrow.
To love and live, but not live to love.
A d'crees sought by woes of many;
A heart shadowed by a stillness clock,
By the foe of twenty men.
A dream stripped from a child's grasp,
Shattered by a hellish song
Sung by a acute sorrow,
By the likes of sorrow d'crees.
