XLVIII. CONTINENCY
There's no great need that you should oft appear
At shews, or help to crowd the theatre.
But if it be expected you should be
Amongst the rest at the solemnity
Of sacred sports, when 'tis requir'd that all
Should join to celebrate the festival;
See with indifference, and lay aside
Partiality, and wish on neither side;
And be not more concern'd for what you see
Than your own quiet and tranquillity.
Be these your main concern, your greatest care,
And wish that things may be just as they are,
And that the victory may fall to him,
Who gains the day, who doth the garland win;
For while to neither, to yourself you're kind,
Nor can you any disappointment find.
Be not transported, do not laugh aloud,
Nor roar in consort with the bellowing crowd.
When the shew's over, when from thence you come,
Dispute not much concerning what was done;
As who's the tallest fellow of his hands,
Who best the lance, who best the sword commands,
Or whether such a one was fairly slain;
This is to act th' encounter o'er again,
But say you out-talk the other, win the prize,
Are you a jot the better, or more wise?
You only shew that you admire the sport,
When there's no tolerable reason for't:
And why so great a wonder is it made,
That a man's quick, or dext'rous at his trade?
That one of greater strength, or greater skill,
Should get the better? that a sword will kill?
