THE DECSION OF MADNESS
The Decsion of Madness
tears of sadness
feel as if they relieve
but do they really?
do they relieve?
i wish the pain was gone
the hurt and sadness
because all it does is cause madness

madness that consumes me
uses me
makes me think things i never would before
and now im on the floor
wanting her even more
but it wont happen now
for the blood is running out
tears of sadness
feel as if they relieve
but do they really?
do they relieve?
the blood is just about gone
so now i wonder
did i make the right decsion?
to make the pain go away?
or should i have stayed?
and waited for happier days?
i will never know now
for the blood is gone
so i say goodbye
for my life is naught
tears of sadness
feel as if they relieve
but do they really?
do they relieve?
