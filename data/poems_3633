REANAS.CENT
To leave God's soul travel elsewhere,
Personify a passion of yearn,
Share human touch without discern,
Oppose a marraipe quite distinct,
Engage re'nasicent corporeal instinct,
Composed saintly by few concerned,
Of Christ who obeyed Fathers law,
Imperfeution God's armour decrees,
Proves right when all is in siege.
Fused moments unable to calm,
Trodden paths undeemed to walk
Trails trials for those who are caught.
Left with doubt to control God's dome,
leaves a sour, a mortal, alone.
