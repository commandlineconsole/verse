A ONE-WAY TICKET
I bought a one-way ticket
so I would not return.
No one seemed to notice.
No one showed concern.
The ticket got me nowhere
that I wanted to be.
No one seemed to notice,
no one 'cept for me.
The strangeness of this new place
made me feel so sad.
No one seemed to notice.
Now I really felt bad.
I wish I had that ticket
so I could return
even if no one noticed
or ever showed concern,
no one 'cept for me.
