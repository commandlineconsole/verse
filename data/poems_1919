BRAINS VS BRAWNS
Those who are smart never get recognized
The so called beauties never realize
The beauty behind those eyes
Or the passion they hide
Because they fear being ridiculed or chastised
While the jocks will fade with the times
Bones so frail they can't even exercise
Their one true love their demise
While the brains may get the Nobel peace prize
Even the military is becoming computerized
So won't the jocks be surprised
When their commander are the ones they victimized
So accept them in your group don't chastise
They might change the ways you look through your eyes
Admit it we're all guilty so apologize
Who knows you might be surprised
At what it means to live their lives
