NEVER KNOW
You never know what you are missing
Untill for ever it is lost
Life goes just once around the sun
And done can never be undone
Years will become memories
Rich or poor, as you invest
How much value you will gain
Depends upon your interest
There are joys and there are pleasures
Do not this two confuse
Pleasure holds charms, joy holds treasures
It will tear your heart to lose
So turn to what in life does matter
Love and all that loving brings
Never grow too old for kissing
Or you'll be lost in all you're missing
