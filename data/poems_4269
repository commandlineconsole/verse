WAKE UP PLEASE
wake up please my dear
i really fear,
fear your dreams
fear your imaginations
it`s really horrible
if you never wake up
so wake up please my dear
i really fear
at first you were in the happy dreams with whole of your heart
now you are in the sad dreams with whole of your heart
but none of them is true
fact is another thing out of dreams
so
wake up my dear
i really fear
