SITTING, STARING
Here I am
Sitting, Staring
At That Candle
Over There
Burning Away
Without A Care
Why can’t I be
More like it
Flickering and flaming
Never taming
Without a care
Never needing to share
Here I am
Sitting, staring
At them drinking
Laughing, smiling
Why can’t I be
Just like them
Hopelessly caressing
Slowly undressing
Without a care
Seemingly unaware
Why is it that I
Never seem to understand why?
Or the ways of the world?
Why is it that
Here I am
Always
Sitting, Staring
But Never Caring
