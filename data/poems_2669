STUFF INBETWEEN
Its a miricle just to see your face.
And it fills my heart with love and
faith.but oh the sadness of loseing
you, when you have the blues.
Its the good times and the bad
and the stuff inbetween that makes
it what it is.but oh the sadness
of loseing you, when you have
the blues.just like the wind blowing
their you are.just like the sea churning
their you are, but oh the sadness of
loseing you when you have the blues.
