PAPER TIGER
It’s powerless to hurt
But still you are afraid
Like many fears it’s overplayed
Like a shapeless fear
It stalks your heart
It can touch you
Or tear you apart
It’s made out of paper
That’s all it is
Is powerless and your powerful
Don’t be fooled by paper fears
That are baseless and faceless
and shaped by tears.
It’s not alive
and will never be real
so heal yourself of your paper fears!
