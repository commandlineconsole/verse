LIKE A SURPRISED SPARK OF AN OLD STAR
Love stole me with these feelings
Love stole me, because of you
Love gives me way to you
And love defines my everything.
I am so amazed
Like a surprised spark of an old star
And feel that
Everything in me has been crazy complete
As I saw you,
In my paradise,
In my life
In my heart.
And every tick of the clock I think of you
You made me insane
For having you here to own
Just like a
Surprised spark of an old star…
