THE BIG SURPRISE
Defying Time and Space,
I traveled all the way
To the end of the colorful
And peaceful Rainbow.
While in transit
Through my long journey,
Hoping to find
That dreamed and
Hidden treasure
Awaiting
To be discovered,
A thousand thoughts
Came across my mind
And in one of them,
Your name was embedded!
Big was my surprise
When reaching my destination,
It was not a treasure chest
Filled with shining gold
I found
But a lovely and smiling Angel
Happily waiting for me!
For my great surprise,
That angel resembles you!
