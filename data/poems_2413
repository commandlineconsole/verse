ANGER
Anger is a terrible thing,
that seeps through your viens...
Making you wish,
others pain.
It's a scary,
emotion...
It drugs your mind,
like a nasty potion.
Blood thirsty,
and seeing red...
People bother you and cause,
that anger to be fed.
You growl,
and snarl...
You wait til,
someone pushes you too far.
You explode,
with rage...
After a horrible fight,
your anger fades.
The person who,
angered you...
Ends up in the hospital,
and you ask yourself 'what did I do? '
You feel,
guilt and sorrow...
You didn't see it coming today,
will you see it coming tomorrow?
