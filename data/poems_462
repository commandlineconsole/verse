WHAT IF WE COULD BE
eyes of passion
blue and tender
a world of love awaits
a sould mate inside
sensual touch
sensual sight
love is strong tonight
love is to unite
passion burns brightly
passion, bodies engage slightly
eyes meet and flutter
lips touch and quiver
voices play together
becomes one together
ill stare into his eyes
and see the nights sky
