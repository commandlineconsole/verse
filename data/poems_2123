WHO'S CAKE IS IT?
That cake looked so good, and caught me bye the eye.
I couldn't help to see that it took me by surprise.
I said, Who's cake is that? I want some too.
There's only one piece left and it's for me.
That's nonsense, I saw it first, what shall I do?
I guess you have to wait your turn because it's mine now.
Alright, step outside to your door near you, I have a surprise for you.
Happy Birthday mother! This punch is for you.
Now who's cake is it now?
I bet not yours.
See, now I can have my cake and eat it too.
