THE SONG WE SING TOGETHER IN JOY UPLIFTS US
THE SONG WE SING TOGETHER IN JOY UPLIFTS US
The song we sing together in joy uplifts us-
The praise of God is our own praise and inspiration -
When we pray with others
We become better with them -
The joy of Hallel
Is what gives the holiday its true tone-
Sing and praise-
Rejoice and love-
Our souls more near
God above.
