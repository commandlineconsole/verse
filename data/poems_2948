SORROW
My sorrow scars left behind,
I still feel my pain and agony,
I still feel the blood that trickled down my arms,
I still see the rage in the face of my own dad,
I cry at night,
All alone,
My body begs me to do it again,
My sorrow doesnâ€™t want to go,
Inching toward a razor again,
Putting it to my wrist like a bracelet,
Pain all of a sudden released and placed with more sorrow,
Why I do these things to me,
I wish I knew,
But the pain fills with relief,
Then replaced with sorrow and hate.
