ENJOY THE PRESENT MOMENT
Enjoy the present moment, fully
without concern, about the past or
the future, for now. I'm certain, you'll
get by, somehow. Looking back, is
not the right course to take. In doing
so, it would be a big mistake. The
future, isn't here yet and will take
care of itself, in due time. Just enjoy
the present and everything, will be
fine. When you start to think about
what was, or could be, it's then, you
start to worry, to no avail. What does
it matter, if at one time, you did fail?
The here and now, is what you
should be concerned about and let
everything else ride. For when push,
comes to shove, you still, have your
pride!
