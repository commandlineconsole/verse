WHENTTHE WORDS COME OUT
Its all over when you
say those words
those hurtful words
you dont care if they
hurt me or make me
cry
You just care that you get
what you want and how
you get it
You dont care that I do everything
in my power not to cry and not
run out of there and never come back
Even if you did care you would never say sorry
if you did care you would just never talk to me
again
Just so you dont have to  face me crying or trying not to.
