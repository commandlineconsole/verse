BETTER DAYS
Better days will come soon
Where will end the trouble's noon
And will show another day
Filled with joy in the way
Where will come huge life's gain
That will take you to the lane
To the lane of joys and smiles
To add color and make worthwhile
All your life and the days
And will fill joy in your ways.
