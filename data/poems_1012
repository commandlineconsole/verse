HAPPY ENDING? ! ?
Oh the joy it brings to my heart
Of the happiness that all can see
From having a good man in my life
Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy
The smiles, the laughs, the twinkles in my eye
Attest to the happiness implored a long time ago
Now it’s found and it’s going to last this time
Forever and ever and ever…
