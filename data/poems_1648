THERE IS NO BEAUTY FOR ME
THERE IS NO BEAUTY FOR ME / LIKE THE FACE OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
There is no beauty for me,
Like the face of a beautiful woman-
How from childhood
The pleasure of seeing
Has been my sin-

And still in old age
When desire cannot even feel itself
That pleasure that longing that beauty-

There is no beauty
Like the face of a beautiful woman.
