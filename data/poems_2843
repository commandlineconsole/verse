THIS LIFE
What is it with life
Things are looking good
You are happy and relaxed
Looking ahead excited
Then all hell breaks loose
Back to gloom and doom
Dark clouds all day
Depression and sadness
Replaces laughter and smiles
I am sick of this life
I can't get it straight
One mess after the other
I bottle it up inside
No-one really understands
I tried and tried my best
It wasn't enough
I go down with despair
Feeling sad and alone
One day it could be too much
Might be time to go
No more errors No more sadness
Just a hole in the ground
