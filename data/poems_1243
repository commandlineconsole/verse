ROMANTIC INTENTIONS
As the darkness of the night sets in
Wonderous dreams of romance begin
Couples walking hand in hand in the moonlight
Wishing dreams of sweet delight
They gaze into each others eyes
Oblivious to time as it passes by
Their lips meet in an act of lustful passion
Sweet adoration for each other never going out of fashion
Uninhiberted acts of love making throughout the night
Accompanied with joyous gasps of sweet delight
Destined to be together until the end of days
Will their love last forever full of passion and blaze.
