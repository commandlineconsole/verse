A CHILD IN THE SEA OF UNCERTAIN
take care of you baby
take care of your skull
you have learnt much
you have specialisation much
you are not authentic
you are talented
not genius
take care of you baby
take care of your skin
in the field of creation
you are simply a dust
to blow away
by the thrust of time
take care baby
take care of your skill
if others give you access
if others appreciate your tune
you are someone
otherwise
no one
you are baby
sheriff or washerman
saint or sir
you are
alone
take care of you baby
take care when you are alone
