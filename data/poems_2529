DIFFICULT FEELINGS
It’s hard to cry a tear, for a person you resent,
It’s hard to shout and scream, yet hard to stay content,
It’s hard to say “I hate you” when to them you are related,
It’s hard to stand and tell them how deeply they are hated,
It’s hard to say “I love you” when you don’t know why you do,
It’s hard to tell the world, about the pain they put you through,
It’s hard to get your head straight, even through the years,
It’s hard to have emotion, yet down your face run tears,
It’s hard to understand the feelings deep inside,
It’s hard to face the facts, so much easier to hide,
It’s hard to have feelings, yet inside you’re feeling cold,
It’s hard to explain, even to the ones you told,
Its hard to know why, your heart feels so hollow,
It’s hard to feel angriness, bitterness or sorrow
It’s hard to have a future, when you’re living in the past,
It’s harder not knowing, if this emptiness will last,
From people you are close, it’s hard to keep things hidden,
Yet harder to explain as to tell remains forbidden,
It’s hard to know why people, do the things they do,
Were other people hurt, or was it only you?
