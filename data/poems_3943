ADDICTION
I care for nothing
than the sound of your voice.
I care for nothing
than the echoes of your name.
I care for nothing
than the aura of your presence.
I care for nothing
than the stares of your bright eyes.
You with me is everything.
Nothing matters to me anymore,
nothing matters to me.
You with me is everything
nothing matters to me.
