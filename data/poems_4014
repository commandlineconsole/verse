BROKEN DOWN
How can you care?
Care about me
Some low life
Living on the streets
Getting stoned everyday
Smelling of rotting garbage
Exposing death it’s self
How can you care?
I don’t
Caring is a feeling
A feeling I’d rather not endure
Because I suffered
As I conquered
Shedding blood
For physical misuse
Screaming tears
Only for mental exploitation
How can you care?
With your plastic smile
Oblivious to pain
Ignorant to truth
I’m young and struggling
In a storm of terror
How can you care?
I’m broken
I’m shattered
I am of no use
I fought life’s battles
I won
I lost
Game over
TRY AGAIN
