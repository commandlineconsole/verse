OCH AYE...BUT NO!
Mention (in passing)
that I like tartan
& now
here you are
in a tiny tartan tank top
in a tiny tartan mini-skirt
matching tartan
(of course…of course)
bra & knickers
and underneath it all
(surprise…surprise)
tartan tit tassels.
I am...overwhelmed.
You look so
cute but
a bit
(over the top)
heavy on the overkill.
I remove each
tartan item
(delicately)
one
by
one.
Such
fun!
Tell you
I love you
just
as you
are.
