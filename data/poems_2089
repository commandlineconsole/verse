UNPREDICTABLE!
Can you know the depth of water, just looking at it?
Can you tell the water is cold or hot, just looking at it?
In the midst of sea, traveling, alone in a boat,
Suddenly a storm arises, and boat turned upside down,
Who is to be blamed?
Depth of ocean, one can say geographically.
Can you measure the one who is just sitting next to you?
Can you measure depth of ones heart?
Can you measure what reaction is on its way to your action?
No one has such an eyesight which can go beyond its sight.
No thing is so transparent as visible.
What's going to happen next to next is unknown.
Humans is to make errors.
Life is trial balance,
If one step wrong, take next step forward.
And balance the trial balance.
Change is sure,
It will come if we go on its way or it may come on our way
Time heals the wounds!
If life was so predictable,
then pain was nowhere to be found.
What happen next is so unpredictable.
We just make some calculations and move forward.
Life is always a challenging one!
Some surprises are so shocking which leaves one blank.
But when each day comes with a shocking surprises,
Life become so used to it, that a surprise never remain a surprise,
As heart becomes heartless with full of such surprises!
This is life!
