CIRCUMSPECTION
Many things i see concern me about people
I see people do stupid things
I see people do things to help the world
I see people do many things that someday they will not be proud of
Concerns come from the stupid things i see people do
If there a thousands of people doing things that i see
The world is a lot worse than what i thought
But other things i see cause me to see the good side of things
People that i see do acts of kindness make me see the world in other ways
But from what i see some people do i am filled with concern.
