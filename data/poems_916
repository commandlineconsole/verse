THE SWEET
The sweet,
sweet dew wets all with joy.
Wet with joy are the night
and the moon.
And dewdrops quiver
over the stars on high.
And joy wet blows
the wind on my face.
It is the season of
the cooling dew!
The dew is falling everywhere,
And wet is every rose.
The gentle breath
of heaven blows.
