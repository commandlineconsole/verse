NOT ALL ABOUT NOW
Life is more about the future
It’s more than today’s pleasure.
You’re not today’s creature
You are the kingdom’s mixture.
It’s not all about the pleasure
You have to sacrifice the leisure
Just to attain that precious treasure
You’ve to ignore the pressure.

You need to endure
Can’t you see the picture?
Even in the midst of your pleasure
Still focus on your awaited treasure.
