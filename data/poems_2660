SADNESS
Hello sadness
where have you been
I thought I lost you
my very good friend
you make me miserable at best
make me lie to everyone I love
'oh I'm just tired'
'I'm fine, just had a bad day'
I thought I lost you
but now you're back
you know I can't miss you
I think I lost track
Give me thoughts I've never thought before
make me look at the mirror, at things I don't adore
feeling like i'm worth nothing
but who am i to tell
I let the sadness take over
wich is telling me i'm in hell
Blame it on the sadness
my lovely friend
the only one who makes you sad
is just you at the end
