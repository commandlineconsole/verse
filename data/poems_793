HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR FARAH
I wish each moment of your special day
To be filled with plenty of joy taht sway
And I hope that may all your dreams
Be filled with life's joy's stream
For no words I think are enough to tell
The joy that I wish in the place you dwell
Because you're an important part of my life
Without which I feel incomplete to survive
And I wish may always you get dear friend
Happiness that has neither bounds nor ends
Where you can live among joy and peace
Till the chapter of your life's story cease.
