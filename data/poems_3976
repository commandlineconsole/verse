TURNING TABLES
Can't you see,
I chase after you
Becuase I see you are not well
I chase after you
But you don't even care
Can't you see,
I love you
More then the heat of the sun
I love you
But you don't even care
Can't you see,
I miss you
More and more with each passing moment
I miss you
But you don't even care
Now you see,
I chased after you
But now I am walking in the other direction
I chased after you
But now I don't care
Now you see,
I loved you
But now the love has ran cold
I loved you
But now I don't care
Now you see,
I missed you
But now I live stronger every moment you're gone
I missed you
But now I don't care
