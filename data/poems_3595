UPON OUR SHOULDES
How can some
live their lives from
day to day, being
concerned only about
the presence
How can others
only know the life
that is their own
a world that exists around
themselves
While we feel
the starving and the poor
the misery
of all life as our
own guilt
While we feel
the millions of tons
of black sorrow
as we carry the world
upon our shoulders
upon our aching, troubled  shoulders
because we are the only ones
who car(e/ ry)
