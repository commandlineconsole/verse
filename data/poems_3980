GOD CARES FOR US,
God cares for us,
God cares for us,
These men are only creeping creatures,
But Bowing Down to the Master is the Reason,
That many plan to Ruin Brothers and Sisters,
Tell me the Good all the time,
That you should never under-rate any man,
Man taught us love and faith,
God care's for Humanity,
The Mouth hast the Sword to say all Spoken Truth,
That life for Humanity will never be the same,
Beyond all Eternity,
Keep waking that you Understand the loving of all the Master's Plan,
This is my love from the soul,
Never forget your Teacher,
Never forget that there was a Master in your life,
The shield and protector,
Love will prevail in Beauty,
God is all Caring for us,
There is a place,
There is a time,
That God is really caring for us,
In His love we should never give up,
The world is all moving with time,
Think that Love is Real,
God is Really Caring,
In this life that seem's so Unfair.
