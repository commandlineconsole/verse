BREATHE
Starry starry skies
within your irises
My soul takes flight
i wish i may i wish i might
Bathe within my heart's delight
...as the pale blue waves take flight
Wistful green pines surge with delight
and the breath of iridescent sight
Explodes inward
hard to fathom at times
how lonely we've become
trapped within this frame of mind
that seems to linger on
we toil and writhe on the melting asphalt
cracked and seething with no end in sight
yet salvation is within our grasp
i'm not talking about some god or angel waiting to swoop down
just a chance to lift the veil
so we can see our self-imposed exile
from humanity
