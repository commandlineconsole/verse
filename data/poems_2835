ONE EVENING
a smile breaking, like a stone into water,
happiness surges as sadness begins to falter,
summer sun surging with a blinding light,
engufling everthing in life, with all its might,
foes become freinds, and freinds grow greater,
sadness, madness and complications are left for later,
as this one moment, is left to be,
all other things forgotten, making it clearer to see,
the important things are left above,
and only one things remains, simple love.
