DO YOU REALLY?
Do you really care; are you actually sorry for what you did?
This heart of mine was bid
Do you really care that the roses you have given to me are dead?
Because my white, satin gown is ripped, torn, and blood red
Do you really care that my memories are faded and lost?
I have an amulet now, instead of a cross
Do you really; do you really care?
