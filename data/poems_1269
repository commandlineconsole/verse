MAIDEN'S MADNESS
I search every man's face hoping it might be you
and every man's face I want to transform so that it is you.
I want to take a scrubbing brush and rub their faces away
and paint yours upon the blank surface that is left
so that I can see you over and over again.
I would then delight in seeing only your face
I would then delight in having only you surrounding me,
turning stopping crushing me to your strong body,
looking into my eyes and lowering your longed for face
and forever fixing it onto mine.
