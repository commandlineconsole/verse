TO WHOM IT CONCERNS
To whom it concerns,
Mason's work won't be late,
But it may fall on his pancakes
And stick to his plate.
To whom it concerns,
My teacher made me write this,
But I'm just a kid,
So how could I fight this?
To whom it concerns,
I didn't lose my assignment,
So I sadly won't get to be
In solitary confinement.
To whom it concerns,
Mason's great when it comes to math,
But girls don't look at nerds
When they're cruising down their path.
To whom it concerns,
I can't wait to be thirteen,
Too weird to be dating,
Too lame to be mean.
To whom it concerns,
I'm just looking for love.
To give & to get some
Would be more than enough.
To whom it concerns,
I am not made of steel,
And when I get blindsighted,
My pain is quite real.
I don't mean to squack,
But it really burns,
Just thought I'd mention it,
To whom it concerns.
