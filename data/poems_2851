LONELY DAY
As I stare into your eyes
I see the sadness you cannot hide
Do you know I love another
Can you feel me slip away
Your arms outstretched for a love that’s flown away
You dropp my hand
You kiss my cheek
Why do you leave as I’m starting to feel weak
The pain we shared that lonely day
Was it there because you walked away
Did you leave because I saw
Did you know I loved you more
I tried to show you since that day
Forever it seems your sadness will stay
I wish we could talk
I wish you would say
What you felt that lonely day
