THE MOSQUE AT CORDOVA (MUHAMMAD IQBAL)
I.
Masjid  e- Qur-tubah
Silsilah-e roz-o-shab
In the flow of light to dark
the jeweller is hard at work.
In the spaces between light and dark,
in birth and death:
Silsilah-e roz-o-shab:
With coloured silken strands,
he works a royal robe.
In the flow of light to dark,
Azal: The pre-eternal sadness,
where the Jeweller speaks
or hisses his decisions,
Weighing you,
dangling me in the balance,
The master assaying
in the shadows, day to night.
If you are wanting–
If I am wanting:
Terii Baraat–
Marii baraat.
Death for the all the worlds
in the kingdom where
there is no day and night.
The works of our hand,
all glister and fashioning
will flash away–
Kaar e jahaa; N be-;  sabaat!
The world comes at last to this!
In the beginning was the end.
Within the form was its formlessness.
Inside the new, its destruction.
At the start of the journey, its end.

In this form*
eternity is formed,
this form made by
a man of God,
a man of passion
a beacon of divine light,
For passion is the center of life
and death cannot overtake it:
Passion forbids death.
Age comes quickly,
in a flash, but passion
is the flood that stops the flood.
In the chronicle of passion
there are nameless
ages beyond
the changing present time:
The breath of Gabriel
The oracle of Mustafa,
The chosen one,
The Prophet’s passion,
The passion of the Lord.
Drunk with passion
from the new made wine
the rose’s face is radiant.
Passion is the mercy
of the keepers of Kabbah
and the leaders of jihad,
the vagabond’s wandering:
It has a thousand resting places.
Passion is the zither and the string
upon which life is played.
Passion the light of life
and passion the fire.
