FLOOD
Anger,
My anger comes in waves,
And then pausing
My tears come like rivers
That flow through valleys
And over cliffs
That spill like waterfalls
Like paint on a canvas
That knows no end
They drip and run
Solid and falling
Only pools they create
Salt baths of fluid
In which I swim and dive and suffocate.
