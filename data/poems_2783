TODAY, THE 12TH DAY OF CHRISTMAS
Today was the 12th day of Christmas
and it was such a special day for me
so unexpected
born out of sadness
but now,
nothing seems the same
as I found something inside
that has previously brought me only sadness
I found love inside of me
It scares me so
but feels so wonderful
I'm speechless
breathless
and realize how fragile
this chance
of caring for someone
now I must tell her how I feel
at great risk I am
but I cannot contain this emotion
she makes me feel
it must be voiced
because I've kept too much inside
