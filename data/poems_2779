POETS, AND WORDS
FUNNY little poets in their
funny plastic hats, they take
the pain and sorrow, put it
in a box, then writes it all
down,
the sadness goes here,
the laughter goes here,
the hope goes here, and
the tears, , over there.
FUNNY little poets in their
funny plastic hats, grabs
a hold of this silence, tells
it to settle down, and wait,
for the picture is about to
start.
THE sadness goes here,
the laughter goes here,
the hope goes here, and
the tears, over there.
