FOR FOOLS
Democracy is for fools
Where they become simply tools
On the name of liberty and freedom
Where rights are respected seldom
Who says people are fully protected?
They are pushed to be infected
With rotten ideas of causes
Its delays and deniable of access
People tolerate as it generates only income
Exploitation is everywhere and welcomed
Why poor are getting poor day by day?
When there are enough off opportunities on the way?
When powers are transferred in the hands of few
The judiciary requires its overhaul and review
No doubt it may provide growth
But push many into jobless leading to death
Think of a plight when money power concentrated
All concerns are taken over by few and deliberated
Upheavals, revolts and attacks by threaten postures
That is how we see the democratic future
Yet it is preferred and appreciated
At least people are heard when infuriated
Their concern is conveyed and realized too
This is another case not very true
You are not killed in day light
You are not pushed in streets to fight
Yet it can be called way of life and system
Everything  must be felt and realized them
