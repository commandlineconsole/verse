LOVE THAT DOESN'T CARE
I don't care about your past,
Like the ocean, my love is vast.
I don't care who you really are,
Just as long as you are mine.
I don't care what you look like,
Because you're beautiful inside.
I don't care about the future,
I already found my fate in you.
I don't care what people say
I'm still crazy for you, anyway.
My darling, my sweetest love,
It's you alone I will always care.
