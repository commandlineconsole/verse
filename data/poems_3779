I DID AND I DO
Memories of all the good times we had
Are running through my head
Knowing now Iâ€™m loosing you
Debating on weather or not I should forever be dead
And all I said were true
Those feelings I had for you
I cared and I still do care
No matter if you are here or the county fair
Those feelings be it short and sweet
Within the passion and the heat
Or cuddled together in the cold
Without a single bad move to be pulled
I cared and I still care for you
Because I said my feeling were true
I did and I do
And I will always care for you
