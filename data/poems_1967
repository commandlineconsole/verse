BIRDS
There’s no need to rush in
When you can tell the way out of here
Surprise me more with the lights
This candle of joy and praise
The flowers grow inside your wings
Before you learn how to fly away
I guess you know where to go someday
When you talk arrogantly to the king
Though I can’t follow your dream
At least I can still see you anyways
Wonder if you can make it out loud
Through the forest of white lies
There’s no need to clear the sky
In such a hurry to find the sun
Surprise me more with the lights
The only thing I could surrender to
