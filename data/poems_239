*670 GOD'S LOVE
God's Love - Springs from eternity
God's Love - Redeeming through history
God's love - Fountain of life to me
So freely - God's  Love
God's Love - Freely for all to share
God's Love - Showing how much he'll care
God's Love - Showing He's always there
So awesome - God's Love
God's Love - Awesome as whitest snow
God's Love - Paying the debt I owe
God's Love - Covers the shame I know
So perfect - God's Love
God's Love - Perfects my holiness
God's Love - Fills all my emptiness
God's Love - Stills all my restlessness
So lovely - God's Love
God's Love - Loving me as I am
God's Love - Filling the heart of man
God's Love - Now and for ever the same
AMAZING - GOD'S LOVE.
We love God because He loved us first.
Even as we were being formed in our Mother's womb.
It is a LOVE that is Free - Awesome - Perfect & Amazing.
How much do I - How much do you - love God in return? ? ?
