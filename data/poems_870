HER LAUGHTER (REVISION OF HER LAUGH DIVINE)
Ah... her laughter,
Known to many, though they know not
That which is heard by the innocent suitor;
Happiness, never known before,
'Til she laughs in cadence divine:
The tone of lovers, happy in life,
The tone of angels who have passed from mankind
To glorious heaven;
The tone of nature in autumn and spring;
If only a light titter;
A quiet chortle;
Only heard a moment,
Still for life obtained:
The joy of her laughter
The joy of those soon to be wed;
The joy of life once saved;
The joy of parent's newborn;
The joy of men who know the light
The joyous tone of perfection....
This feeling, nearly an obsession;
This feeling of love,
Known only to those who have heard her laugh.
