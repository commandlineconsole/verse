WHEN SORROW LOSES LIFE
Ours is a sorrow,
that spills out,
endlessly from a well,
on the dried leaves,
until the core of the well,
dries itself of endless,
tears lashing against rocks,
built within our eyes.
Ours is a sorrow,
that tightens the soil,
as the river of blood spilled,
out from the clash of titans,
flows between the cracks,
of the diffident earth,
while, the ignorant clouds,
move on the fleece-like,
floor of the garish blue.
Ours is a sorrow,
that reveals its,
shadow on the footpath,
when feeling tired rests,
in the coffin under,
the generous monuments that,
provide a home to it.
This is when,
sorrow loses its meaning........................................
