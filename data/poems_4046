FEAR!
i fear the change that is occuring in me i dont know how to stop it
i fear that i trust too much
i fear that i love to much
i fear that i will fall too hard
i fear the crush
i fear i will act upon this
i fear i will mess up
i fear real connections
i fear the change
i dont fear having children
i dont fear being in love
i dont fear comitment
i fear the end
