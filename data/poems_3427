WE'D LIKE TO MAKE THIS PERFECTLY CLEAR
With all due respect.
And with our expressed sympathies,
Extended.
Our policies have been slandered.
And,
Misunderstood amongst those with beliefs,
Our concerns and actions depict a lack of consciousness.
Those indigenous folks,
Suffering tremendous loss from misinterpretations of progress,
That are 'claimed' to have had an adverse affect on them,
In the Amazon...
Is a media event to heighten low ratings.
And,
Furthermore...
With emphasis on empathy.
We'd like to make this perfectly clear,
A perception of our greed and thoughtlessness...
Has been more than exaggerated.
'Even though recent videotapings of human remains,
Floating in the waters with ruined vegetation...
Has captured a gross disrespect for the region.
And is directly associated with the activities of your company? '
With all due respect.
And with our expressed sympathies,
Extended.
Our policies have been slandered.
And,
Misunderstood amongst those with beliefs,
Our concerns and actions depict a lack of consciousness.
Those indigenous folks,
Suffering tremendous loss from misinterpretations of progress,
That are 'claimed' to have had an adverse affect on them,
In the Amazon...
Is a media event to heighten low ratings.
'Then who is to blame,
For this miscalculation of both justice...
And the spirit of wellbeing enforced,
By the Council of World Environment Protection?
Where IS that concern for our fellow human beings? '
With all due respect.
And with our expressed sympathies,
Extended.
Our policies have been slandered.
And,
Misunderstood amongst those with beliefs,
Our concerns and actions depict a lack of consciousness.
Let this be understood,
We are thoroughly and without question...
Extremely conscious of our misdeeds.
