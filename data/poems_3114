SADNESS AND SORROW
Depression, Sadness, Tear shed
Sorrow and neglect
Not A Friend in the world
Nothing but art is All I have
Poetry, song, and Art
My True art forms
Music and Art, Poetry and story writing
my true art forms tell of 5 that go hand-in-hand
When sorrow comes, It's hard to let go
Then it is followed by Depression
Followed more by Neglect and Loneliness
Finally followed up by sadness and Tearshed
Who Am I now?
My Life is a bummer
I never smiled
Since I lost my uncle
These 5 feelings, Hand-In-Hand
Follow me like a gloomy raincloud
Where Ever I Go
I cry at times, even to sleep
I miss you so, there's a void in my heart
that needs to be filled, I loved you so
Now that you're gone, Who will Fill that void?
nothing but that Sadness And Sorrow
Nothing but that sadness and sorrow
Will Follow me now, I, Am so lonely
without Your love and guidance
Dear Uncle, Rest In Peace
I shall See you again soon
Until Then, Uncle, Sleep well
My Angel, My angel of light
I'll see you soon. R.I.P.....
