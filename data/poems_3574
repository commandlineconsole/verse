FINDING PICASSO
Insistently occur in the
Mind of manmade concern:
Evolved through the satire
Of paint brush stain:
Obvious to get a
Visual page:
Of Untainted, fine
Vividly age;
Uttered, mundane face with
The glow of the lamp;
Insane images once painted
With the fired camp:
The enigma carries
The future of another era-
To find the civil layer
Of eventful phases:
Of Every epoch; in my eyes,
With my superior, agile faith;
With my endless thrust;
