NO FEAR
My heart is thrown away
This is the call of the brave
My feelings can't stay
Because my fear can not wait
All anger can do is crave
All the guilty pleasures
Will not be saved
This will be committed by pressure
Imagery can be so neat
All emotions stand under my feet
Happiness, fear can easily devour
But courage is filled with power
Sadness
Can hold me back
Happiness
Could send me off to the wrong track
Steady eyes
Have the sharp edges of a blade
An cut is made in the light
The darkness of fear have been slayed
Foolish things are done
Things that can make anyone's blood run
Jump over the cliff and try to touch the sun
If you fail, you shall die with a stupid grin
Heart heavy with emotions
They have stopped my almighty courage
They may be life's devotion
But to me they are just a heavy burden
Part away from me
To death I shall bleed
The ones with courage shall be free
Without adventure, one's life will be bleak
Fear will block the enjoyment in life
How can you have fun?
When all you can do is stand by
Don't let fear catch you on the run
Have no fear
Fall to earth with a sip of beer
Fall down with no fear and no cry
If possible add emotions with life
Do something or the enjoyment in life will leave you behind
