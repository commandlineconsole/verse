LOVE IS.....
love is a hard thing to explain
love is not a feeling nor a emotion
it is a passion
a passion for someone
who you desire in your life
i have that feeling
it is so strong
i cant take it
but those who try will prevail
and they will have that passion filled
and the desire will shrink
but it will still be there
always there even when you lose your passion
it will still be there beating like a heart
