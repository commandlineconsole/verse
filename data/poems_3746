WE WOULD BE ON THE MOON (MY SONG)
We were just standing there,
blank-faced stare,
without a clue.
We would just be alone,
where's the moon,
I thought you knew.
I thought you cared, cared, cared......
Why'd you leave?
Was it our seams?
It locked me in.
Oh, don't just walk away,
stay some more, don't be rude.
I thought you saw.
I thought you cared, cared, cared......
So, don't, don't be a living death,
like our toddler, blue,
questions knew.
He thought we knew.
He thought we cared, cared, cared......

but he knew, in his mind, that we knew that Mars would be there all along.......
