TEARS
Tears of pain, tears of sadness
Not knowing what you are thinking
Leads me to madness
Innocent of wrongfulness I am
But you like to believe the worst
Sleepless I will be
Till the morning thirst
I want to be the best for you
I try to the point of exhaustion
What’s meant to be will be
And I believe you were made for me
So these tears of pain and sadness
Will hopefully be gone
Because with one kiss from you
All my worries don’t last long
