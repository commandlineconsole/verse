ANGRY WORDS
When we make arrogant sounds
In anger we spoil something
Bile and bad blood
Fill our chest and choke
Throttles us to spit
Diatribes and ill
It is what we say
That shows what is in our heart
Sad heart, sad words
Bitter heart, bitter words
Angry heart, angry words
The story never changes.
Proud words said in anger
Not stopped
Not checked
These words are like fire
On a roof of common thatch.
