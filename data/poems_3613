TO LIVE WITH CRISIS
We have learnt to live with the crisis
So much can be written as pure thesis
It is not that we have lost moral base
Everybody has become conscious and wants to be at ease
Those were the days when people used to rise in revolt
Some of the incidences were coming like jolt
It was never on expected lines and proved decisive
The people have risen to the occasion and not remained submissive
It is mass demonstration of strong resolve
If no grievances are addressed to or care is taken to solve
The public outburst is legitimate concern
It engulfs entire region in turn
People were offering life while facing bullets
They were putting obstacles at all outlets
The nationalist spirit was really at heart
They did not want even little to part
The nobility was never questioned
The royal houses were always honored
The public concern was their most priority
The olden history is praising this as their best quality
The duties and rights were equally weighed
The line was known and clearly laid
The loyalty was never in doubt
Today nothing of that sort talked about
Public has no time for such activities now
The glory and fame has become thing of past
No one may risk the life for silly reasons
There are no worth personalities to lead as persons
They have enough of stemina on tolerance
They want no more lesson or references
The radical steps has witnessed sea change
People have loved to live with the age
Now nothing bothers such as unrest and strikes
Unemployment and poverty has less dislikes
The statistics educate them about the real scene
The difficulties and problems are understood and seen
The student unrest or mass protest is seen as stage managed
The corporate bodies, politicians have never salvaged
The deep crisis concerning public at large
The end game is open and no one wants it to enlarge
The action is aimed at diverting the public opinion
Some of them are contemplated by the powerful unions
Greedy and local leaders are not staying behind
They too want their lions share to find
The public suffers as holy cow
Total concept and view points are changed now
No one has regard for humanity or nationality
Every one is trying to score so as to prove ability
Nothing has remained holy as it was before
No right persons are coming forward therefore
The public has understood the game
No one is prepared to share the blame
