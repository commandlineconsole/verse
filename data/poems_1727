THE MYSTERIOUS VEIL
Biding the time
Lying in wait
Holding the phone
Marking the time
Sweating it out
Patience a virtue
Longing for love
Year after year
Month after month
Hour by hour
Minute to minute
The moment near
Time for joy
Thirst shall quench
Hunger be appeased
Craving for pleasure
Pleasure be theirs
The time arrives
Fear is evident
Palms do sweat
Nervous is laughter
The bride sits
Thoughts pass quickly
Any second now
Time honored traditions
The groom sits
He leans forward
The mysterious veil
Is finally raised
Truth be known
Congratulations?
