ALL TRUST IS OF LOVE
All trust is of love and of feeling's touch
A tender music that fills the coming hours
Like a heart that loves with its beats so much
Or breeze among the summer wild free flowers
Their tunes of delights from inside tongue
Every touched desire of feelings and play
The beats upon thousands that each passion long
And never quite the same to the moments stay
Colors in fires that delight and give
Dissuade no senses that cannot ever be
Their beauty that's upon sanity to relive
To make each love feeling of hope and free
This all is from heart and its pounding beat
Forever true in its path none to deceit
