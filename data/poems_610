DEEP DOWN
Deep down inside me, a passion burns
Deep down in me, a secret passion is rising
Making me desire you more, making me jealous
The feeling that I can not breath and exist without you
The idea that there is only one for me, you and, only you
The wanting deep down, trying to escape me, trying to be spoken
The feeling which cannot be described in written or words spoken
Your heart telling you want that person more, that you want them in your arms
Dreams filled with only you make my nights fly by, dreams of ideal situations
Dreams of nights cuddled up warm to you and passionate nights out on the river
Love can find its own way, speak true the words you feel, never hold back
