WIDE OPEN IN THE RAIN
It might be some pleasure
or it might be some pain,
Still you're wide open, wide
open in the rain,
You're dressed like a
naked eye, and your tears
welcome you,
but you can't cry-
It might be some pleasure
or it might be some pain,
Still you're wide open, wide
open in the rain-
The falling rain finds you asleep,
and in your broken heart, the
darkness runs deep-
It might be some pleasure
or it might be some pain,
Still you're wide open, wide
open in the rain-
