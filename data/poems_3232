JIGSAW OF LIFE
Square   peice of sorrow
Diamond peice of faith
Jagged   peice of hate
Oblong    peice of hope
Stepping stones
Peices of paper
Wooden blocks
Many roads to wander
Many turns to take
Many mistakes to ponder
Many joys to shed tears
Sorrow, happiness, hate, faith and hope
Fit together at times
Easier than others
Patience they say
Will win at the end of the day
Whatever your picture
Please remember
Many goes it may take
To put your picture together
Lifes jigsaw puzzle is no easy task
