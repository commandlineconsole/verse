FROM THE DISTANCE
In a grief stricken morning, as I plunge my heart deeper into sorrow,
Lose myself upon my sorrow of the souls, sorrow bared to strangers,
As a maiden from a greater distance, she saw my deepest sorrow,
And she took away this sorrow, sealed it in a burrow,
And I hear her youthful voice, laden with sorrow, like I,
And our voices would come to soothe the aching from the heart,
And then we saw each other from the distance, and we say,
'Our love will come together at last, '
And the grief I thought was buried in a burrow, rising forth,
As I see that the distance was greater than what I foresaw it last,
I ache to feel, to touch the softest skin to touch,
From the distance, it would not let it pass,
I thought the happy days would last, from the distance, so fast,
From the start it seemed to last, but the distance, too vast,
Her voice I only hear, her face I only see,
But as I reach to touch, this distance so vast.
