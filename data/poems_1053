THE JOY OF LIVING,
The joy of living,
The joy of living is restoring my soul,
This is the joy that I will increase,
Thinking that the asset is all the beauty,
You are the son of the most high,
In the world today,
I found that the heavenly is the joy of living,
Making up to my making,
This is the man that is all beautiful,
Understand that in the society,
The world is all very rough and tough,
This is the logic that I will never fail,
Come and make me understand that you are the truth,
In all that is to be done,
You gave me Authority,
That by every word you spoke,
Really meant to bless me in all my afflictions.
