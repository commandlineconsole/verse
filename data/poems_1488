POET TREE PLEASURE
Soft light green
are the leaves of spring,
they energise, give new life,
revive, make new,
rejuvenate
our living passion.
The trees pleasure
is now our pleasure.
Good poetry,
can fertilise,
revitalise, renew,
inspire new thought,
can comfort or
create new passion.
The poets pleasure
is now our pleasure.
For it is our pleasure
to see new green leaves
our pleasure to read
good poetic works.
They must both come
from, the same life spirit
that runs through all.
For is it not like magic,
both begin to grow?
