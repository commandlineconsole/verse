BUFFALO SUNRISE
There is nothing more impressive
Than a beautiful Buffalo Sunrise
If you visit the Wichita Mountains
You are in for a big surprise
Imagine a spectacular lake
A back dropp at the start of a day
With a Buffalo loping along there
During his early daylight graze
The stillness of the morning
The blush of a perfect sky
Brings you in touch with nature
So beautiful you might just cry
And put this magnificent animal
In the midst of this lovely day
No, nothing could have more beauty
As you go along your way
There are so many special moments
That will bring a sweet surprise
But I would love to start the morning
With a spectacular Buffalo Sunrise!
