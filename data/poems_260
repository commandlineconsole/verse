WHATEVER YOU MAKE IT
Love is a game
My love game is sick
I'll have you fallin' quick
Love causes pain
Let my love take your heart
aching pain away
Love is heartbreaking
Trust that i wont break
Your heart only protect it
So can you feel this love connection
Love is a long-term commitment
Forever toghter you and me
Love is an addiction
Your addiction is my love
My love is a drug
A drug you can't get enough of
Love is time-consuming
So be patient with me
Love is real
If you find the right person to love
Love can be fake
When you're in lust
Fall to fast and become lost
With the wrong one
Love is whatever you make it
