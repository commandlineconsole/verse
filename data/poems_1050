JOY
Joy,
Lighthearted,
Amazing,
Funny,
Beautiful,
She is a light in a darkened room,
A flower growing out of salted earth.
But inside,
pain,
Hidden away,
and hard to see,
But it is there,
eating away,
like a disease.
I hope dearly,
That I can cleanse the pain,
resonating deep in her breast.
Joy,
So much fun,
Joy... you bring a smile to everyoneâ€™s face,
And no one could ever take her place,
I love Joy
And no matter how the people in her life treat her,
I will always be standing in her corner,
protecting and loving her eternally
