TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN...
To whom it may concern...
I don't have any way to let my feelings out...
I was never taught how to let things out
To whom it may concern...
I left scars as a reminder
A reminder to teach my children how to let things out
To whom it may concern...
I've tried to change
I couldn't do it though...
Because i had no support...
To whom it may concern...
I hate the body i have...
Its all most guys want me for
To whom it may concern...
I listen to my kind of music...
Because i feel like someone understands  how i feel
To whom it may concern...
I feel like i get no attention from my parents...
Unless i do something bad, or something that gets them mad
To whom it may concern...
Im going to start getting my parents attention more often
Im going to get real good at being bad...
To whom it may concern...
