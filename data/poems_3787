WHO WILL CARE FOR THE PEOPLE?
Who will care for the people; lost, confused and canâ€™t find their home
Who will care for the people; raped, striped and left without anything of their own
Who will care for the people; who once had land, cattle and a harvest to reap?
Who will care for the people; who now possess despair and fear that denies them sleep?
Who will care for the people; that served only kindness but were fed a platter of pain?
Who will care for the people; who have been inflicted with cruelty again and again?
Who will care for the people; who for generations were treated unfairly?
Who will care for the people; that are the reflection of me?
They maybe many but I will mention the one that is familiar
This can be none other than the honourable Mr. Hamilton Ratshefola
