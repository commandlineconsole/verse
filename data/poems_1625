A SINGLE MALT
The water of life
Sweet welcome pleasure
I pour you with love
Others drown you forever
They mix you with coke! even lemonade!
The poor uninitiated
How they ruin your taste
Never a teenager,12 yrs you mature
Freed from the cask, to be impisioned in bottles once more
Sweet water of life
Sweet welcome pleasure
Bring me the freedom
Release me forever
