THE POET
The poet bares his soul to the world
Opening himself to minute examination
His thoughts to be sifted and sorted
Interpretation put on every word
But have no fear from these deliberations
Just pleasure … from whatever pleasure is gleaned
For the written word is his chariot …
To carry his thoughts across the minds of men
