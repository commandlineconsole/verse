TECHNO LOVE
Joy and passion
The beginning of all
Text my heart to
My latest blog
Warmth form my soul
I send to you
Passion and joy
The end doesn't come
Reach out and touch another
Email and instant message
Send out my digital love
Taste my technological lust
Freedom is the key
But its action that
Opens the door

I cry for the loves that I lost
And for the love I will never know
