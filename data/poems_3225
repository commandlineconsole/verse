ADDICTION TO DEATH
Cutting's like a drug
You get hooked so fast
You hide yourself from the world
Not daring to face it
Scared of what you’ll see
You're hiding the scars
By long sleeves and fake smiles
Dreading confrontation
Dieing all the while
Slipping thru your skin
The blade takes your sorrows
Bleeding out your troubles
One by one
Till they’re gone
You should feel guilty
For being like this
This sick demented animal
With this twisted mind
But you’re void of feeling
Depression, happiness,
Sorrow and hope
These mean nothing
Just more words
Written at random
You’re empty, not feeling
Living in a daze
Pain is beyond you
Only your addiction remains
Your addiction to death
