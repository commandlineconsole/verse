LOVE IS MYSELF
You told, love hurts
Hurt it might
I still love ‘coz
I love love
You told, life betrays
Betrey it might
Yet I care not ‘coz
I am myself
Love is no trade
Don’t trade in love
Don’t ever love
To get joy back
Love is no commodity
Don’t buy and sell
Don’t ever love
To get love back
What is love, then,
Love my being
Love is myself
Love is my life
