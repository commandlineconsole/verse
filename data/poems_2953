THE SWEET SOUND OF SORROW
I have had my share do not despair
the sweet sound of sorrow
Sorrow so deep I could not sleep
Thinking this must all end tomorrow
If your looking for another that understands your sorrow
Drop me A line and I will fallow
And I'll show you some time
how when I can not sleep I weep
The sweet sound of sorrow
