DO I CARE
I don't care what you do
Just remember, I still love you
I don't care who else you find
Just remember, your still mine
I don't care what you say
Just don't go away
I don't care, or do I?
I do care, and I don't lie
I do care what you do
Because its trouble I don't want you to get into
I do care who else you find
Because it is us that should be combined
I do care what you say
Because to be with me I want you to stay
So as you try to find another girl to replace me
Remember that I love you
For your personality
