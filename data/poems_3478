WHO AM I
I am me, a walking talking living human
I, caged in my brain myself in command
Always thinking carried by my train of thoughts
Stopping at sadness of life rebounding with kindness,
Aggression laughter and sadness in life's situations
God's master creation the human race, heart bound
Expelling feelings of all kinds, I one of
Billions on earth each with their own
Concerns naturally for their own family,
Concern for a happy life to be born free.
I expel my thoughts that we all should
Live in the kingdom of freedom.
I am me, I am free, not so for many
In this world with human conflict.
Love fills my heart, love is the start
For a world of the free, yes,
For you and I, thru the eye of wisdom.
