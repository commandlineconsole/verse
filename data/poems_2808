DEEP SADNESSS
Today I woke up with deep sadness
I dreamed about him
and it sucked because i laid in bed for good one hour
just thinking about him
but apart from loving him and all
i had this deep sadness because all of thing that i regretted
I really want him to know how much hurt i am going through
not being there for him and with him
I've been scared to be honest
how I feel because I dont want to sound weak
desperate or creepy
I want everyone know that I love him and care for him
and that i will be there for him... always
