SOMEONE
The oil of gladness,
The wine of peace;
Every house is built by someone.
Concerning that which was written,
Concerning that which was spoken,
Concerning that which was read,
Every car is driven by someone.
Today if you will hear my voice,
Do not harden your hearts;
Yes, every poem is written by someone.
