SPECIAL JOY
There was a time when I never knew
The actual meanings of joy that's true
And how one feels when one get
Special joy with a happiness set
But the day when I first saw you
That's when I realized too
That happiness 'n joy grows inside
Our heart 'n mind that is wide
And to get them what we must do
Is to look at things nice 'n true
So this way we can learn to enjoy
How to gather for us special joy.
