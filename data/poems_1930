LITTLE SURPRISES
Nasty little surprises are sitting in the way
In the way of your life each day
so learn to handle them all with care
And don't expect life to be always fair
And try to remove the sketches of pain
And let your troubles pour like rain
And try to jot down happy thoughts
And see the pleasure that is brought
One by one in to your life
And see how spirit that in it survive
Clears all the fog and the mist
From your life's trouble's list
And then you'll see in this race
How things are changing face
And bringing for you and in your way
Nice little surprises in each of your day.
