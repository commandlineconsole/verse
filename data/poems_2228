' ANGER '
Anger i have Anger i did
Anger so hot, in Furnace i lived

Venting and Fuming, Huffing and Puffing
Consuming my Soul, some memories old
Burning and Seething, misdeeds repeating
Spreading hurt and making Hearts cold

Anger so toxic, it heated up my Veins
this hot blood then reached my Brain
all rationale and logic then failed
pelted everyone, lashing words like ' Hail '

Anger so frequent, there was no peace
even in Icelandic cold, i wouldn't freeze
Steaming my actions to undiscovered 'Darkness '
Words like 'Razor ' cutting souls with  'Sharpness

All my Love, this Anger consumed
where did i find it and how come so soon?
Saw it, felt it perpetually in Denial
Let's extinguish it with something remedial

Surrounded myself with things of Beauty
keeping it at bay, like a ritual and a Duty
Sigh... i will Breathe again
When, in my veins ONLY ' love' remains

Anger i can't, Anger i don't
The Coffin of Anger, i Buried alone!
