* A SEED WITHIN
what are you going to do?
he might ask
are you going to wait

are you going to wait
for the seed to take root
bloom and bear fruit

leave it to me
he might say
i will give you the fruit in a capsule
you give me your seed...why toil
he would ploy

A FRUIT IN A CAPSULE IS'NT A FRUIT AT ALL

The path too is a joy
the growth too is a joy
from the seed to the fruit

a spiritual share is a joy too
the giver and the taker share the joy
if it was a share
which gave you joy
how can you use it
as a ploy
