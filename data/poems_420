PASSION AND COMPASSION
PASSION AND COMPASSION
Jesus Christ was crucified,
Lord Buddha  got enlightenment,
For passion and compassion,
The voices of Gandhiji and Martin Luther,
Were silenced by bullets,
But where is passion and compassion today,
Money has become the creater,
Of all the evils
We should adopt passion and compassion
