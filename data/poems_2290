PAIN, HOPE, ANGER, TIRED, FEAR, LOST.
Pain, hope, anger.
Tired, fear, lost.
the pain within is only our own to bare
the hope is our mind playing tricks on us
the anger is finding there is no life
the tired of being pushed around
the fear of losing
the lost
Pain consumes the world
Hope is lost
anger is held high
Tired always
Fear consumes our minds
Lost is all our hopes
Pain can not beat us
Hope still shines the smallest ray of light
anger is controled
fear minimizes
lost is the feeling of emptyness
The pain wont hold us back
The hope shines the way
The anger can not harm
The fear is gone
The lost is home.
