THE JOY OF LIFE
The joy of life is living
In living there is loving
In loving there is caring
In caring there is sharing
What you don’t have, you can’t share
But never go beyond your means to find something to share
You might lose yourself in doing so
So share what you have, as long as you can
Others will see that you really and truly care
And they will love and help you to live your life
And give you the joy, that only few hold dear,
The joy of life
