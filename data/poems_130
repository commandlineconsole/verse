LOVE CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING
Love can change everything
Love love and love love
Love can open the close-gate of enemy
Love love and love love.
Love can change everything
Love all in the open jungle
And in the broken boat
In water-less sea.
Love love and love love
Love can change the sky
You can fly in love without wings
With no self-interest.
