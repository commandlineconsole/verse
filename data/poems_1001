A DEGREE OF JOY
Emit joy's light
And make things bright
For people around you
And show then fain's view
Where joy and pleasure
Are treated as a treasure
And where well lived life
teaches the art to survive
In both dull and bright
Phases that are right
Where joy and sorrow meet
To make our life complete.
