ESTHER(2)
why can't everything go right
why is nothing ever right
why can't you be mine
i've always dreamt of your smile
why can't we walk the mile
why don't you walk the aisle
your lips tastes like rye
i promise to make a difference
never to put you in suspence
dear love, my heart sings for you, everything i do is for you.
