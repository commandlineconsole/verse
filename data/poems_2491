MISLEAD TRUTH
Blood continues to seep
These wounds bleed deep
Never healing never ending
These thoughts never bending
This pain grows strong
Realizing everything is wrong
Why so tragic
This needless dramatic
This is me for a while
Ive lost that smile
Why, cause my anger grows
Cause my hate arouse
Continuing this thought
Finding myself caught
Are you worth it this time
For such a simple rhyme
These feelings confused
Knowing happiness refused
While anger now subsides
Back in my heart it resides
Half-heartedly content is what we decide
