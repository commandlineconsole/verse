YOU ARE MY DELIGHT
I painted you skies of blue and hills of wildflowers;
I gave you the sun and clouds that rain showers.
I speckled the skies with moon and stars at night;
I gave my life loving you; you are my delight.
I brought forth snow capped mountains
And timed geysers that spurt like fountains.
I  planted the trees and meadows for your sight
I've done it all for you; you are my delight.
I created the ocean, sea, river, brook and lake
Rock, stone, sand, dirt, soil~all for your sake.
I gave you graces enough to make your toil light;
I would do it all over again; you are my delight.
I fashioned you in my Image, my precious one
To imitate Jesus Christ, my own Beloved Son.
He sacrificed His Life to make your soul white.
Why? Because I love you; you are my delight.
I treasure nothing more than you, my child;
Your eternal Triune God is holy and undefiled.
You and all things were created through my might.
You belong to me, my love; you are my delight.
I lay my plan before you with wisdom for the day
To acquiesce humbly and follow my way;
Pray and ponder that your soul may take flight
And be joined to mine; you are my delight.
