WHAT I DON'T HAVE
What I don’t have concerns me a lot.
I strive for it every day.
What I do have concerns me not.
In fact, it seems in my way.
Like money, houses and cars.
I always felt I was among
Those missing their shooting stars.
Even today when I look around
I don’t think I have enough.
No matter what fortune I’ve found,
I’m worried that things are tough.

Others seem to have more than I do.
I’m amazed at how much they’ve got.
I wonder if it has something to do
With things that concern me not.
