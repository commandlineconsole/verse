I LOVED YOU
I love you like I was blind
I love you like everything was fine
I love you like there was no time
I care about you with no despair
I care about you even though it isn’t fair
I care about you even though you aren’t there
I hold you like you told me
I hold you like you’re gold
I hold you when you’re cold
You never really paid
Or even came to my aid
And yet I stay with you
Even when you weren’t true
I loved you like you were fake
I cared for you so you wouldn’t break
I held you so I wouldn’t ache
Now what will it take?
