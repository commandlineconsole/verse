ANGER
All I can feel inside me
Is what they call anger
This is all I can say
You're a faker
I hated all of you
You made me feel alone
You made me feel cold
Inside me I thought I broke a bone
All I can feel is nothing else
But anger
I know one thing
My life's gone darker
Why do all of you
Made me feel like this
I hate you all
You're chances had been missed
I thought you all cared
But you all lied
And I feel scared
But also angry
Maybe I need to cool down
But one thing for sure
I had a melt down
You all lied
Maybe now
Goodbye
