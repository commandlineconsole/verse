SHE LOVED HIM, HE LOVED HER
They meet on a day like no other
she loved him, he loved her
After that day she never thought about another
she loved him, he loved her
She was the breath that gave him life
she loved him, he loved her
He was tho moon that lite up her sky
she loved him, he loved her
Every moment they shared was a gift
she loved him, he loved her
so young and in love with ignorant bliss
she loved him, he loved her
He knew her inside and out
she loved him, he loved her
Yet he could not decipher what the sorrow in her eyes was about
she loved him, he loved her
She knew she loved him very well
she loved him, he loved her
but how did he feel? at times he couldnt tell
she loved him, he loved her
though they had problems they both held them inside
she loved him, he loved her
unfortunately building a tention that neither one of them could deny
she loved him, he loved her
She slid into a desolate, deep, dark place
she loved him, he loved her
but kept that beautiful smile, and never allowed a frown to escape
she loved him, he loved her
He began to hurt and his heart fell bitter
she loved him, he loved her
The happiness he once felt began to shrivel and wither
she loved him, he loved her
Now so deep in love neither has the courage to leave
she loved him, he loved her
This cant be the end is what they wanted to believe
she loved him, he loved her and they meet on a day like no other
never knowing the pain they would cause each other
or the joy and happiness they would feel finally knowing they found something real
but the pain was just to much
and communicate they did not enough
His heart died and her soul was crushed
yet she loved him, he loved her
but was love worth this hurt?
And so goes another love tragedy that time continues to prove
that love you can have but it is the one you love you will lose.
