CONCERNING OUR WEARY LIMBS
Concerning Our Weary Limbs
You are invulnerable as I stare intently upwards;
Wishing (more than what is warmth or shade)    to conquer you.
Determined to discover your cleverly hidden beginning;
And whispers “To find one should be amazing enough.”
You and I have begun our marvelous intricate scales and descents.
(There is no longer a Below, you are made of thousands of patterns of
Which I must make my own; and I will not ascend you – wonderfully Anew, I know with the wrong or the simple.)
You are, I imagine, growing tired.  You will nonetheless support our
Symbiotic journey; for I too, am weary.  You were complex.
You are growing clear.  What was new and wonderfully strange
Is, at the moment, beautifully familiar.
(And I am smiling, to find what you are like.)
(!)
You have descended me.
And I have beautifully conquered you.
It ended such in a chorus that has transcended
Everything.  The entirety of you, has shown me
(As I found what you were like)    fewer and fewer
Things to be concerned, until I reached our end.
And look.
(I can see my house beneath your limbs.)
