MY TOWER.
My tower, shine your day's light, have my feet in your delight
this way they will not walk in fright, neither will they stumble with the burdens that see you eye to eye.
At night, my sisters eyes are shut tight
at this time I begin to fight.
I can only find the company of solitude, as my bed swallow my tears
it is sorry so pain is it's gratitude.
My tower, shine your day's light, have my feet in your delight.
