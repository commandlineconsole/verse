ENVY
Not all get happy in
other's happiness
Joy of someone
becomes pain of
others and pain
brings smile.
When smile tickles
on someone's pain
that smile worth not
having.
Man are sad not for
their miseries but of
joy his neighbour making.
Wicked joy of jealousy
makes man mean
and he commits endless sin.
Stop this Leg pulling
and grow up, you too
can get what others got.
