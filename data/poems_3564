I AM JUST POETIC
i have a red melon
which i put on the
table
i am concerned
about you
you must be hungry
i like you to eat
and be happy
if you are ready
please take the shadow
of my melon before you
slice spirituality and
and satisfy yourself with
something virtual
come to think
of it
i am just poetic
