FEAR NOT MY LOVE
Fear not my love
Take me back into your heart
Fear not my love
Let us make a fresh start
Fear not my love
The past is behind
Fear not my love
No more doubts in your mind
Fear not my love
Let me give back all I abused
Fear not my love
Perspicuous, lucid, unconfused
Fear not my love
I'll not withhold or reserve
Fear not my love
You shall have all you deserve
Fear not my love
In my arms be secure
Fear not my love
For all time it will endure
Fear not my love
It is yours for the taking
Fear not my love
It is ours for the making
Fear not my love
Seek the future we planned
Fear not my love
Together hand in hand
