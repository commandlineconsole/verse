I AM POEM
I am rolling in he deep
I wonder when i will stop rolling with everyone else
I hear people saying bad things about me it makes me feel that i should kepp rolling intil i am depp in sorrow
I see everyone still while i am rolling all around
I want to stop rolling in deep sorrow
I am rolling in the deep
I pretend to be like everyone else not rolling in deep regret but still, still as life can be
I feel in deep sorrow rolling in the worst thoughts
I worry about someone finding out about my deepest darkest secrets
I cry when i can not stop rolling in deep sorrow
I am roliing in the deep
I undersyand that one day i will stop rolling in the deep regret
I i say that no one should be rolling in deeo sorrow but still
I dream that i am still that none of those deep thoughts have ever accured
I try to stop the rolling but the rolling is going to the deepest regret the rolling has taken over
I hope one day one minute one moment oone second one hor i willl stop rolling
I an rolling in the deep
