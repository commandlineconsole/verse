SHOULD YOU YEARN, I YEARN TOO!
The ocean wants for the shore-the shore, its destination;
Flowers want for the Sun and rain, which aid in their formation;
Birds want for the sky-the sky, home to their freedom, complete;
I want for thee, with nary a thought of my heart's retreat!
The long, dark night, longs for the bright dawn of a new day;
Winter-weary fauna long for the rebirth of Spring's sway;
The human soul longs for its mate-its solitary compeer-
Every night lacking mine, I long for thee to be ever more near!
Blurred now have been the lines betwixt your's and mine-
Where before I had concerns of my own, now they meet with thine!
Your wants are now wants of my own-thee, I assure;
I spare not imagination in my emotion-you though, demure!
Your longings have now another champion-they are now my concern too-
Your needs are now needs of my own-should you yearn, I yearn too!
