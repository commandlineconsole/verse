CONCERNING YOU AND I!
Many waters,
Many rivers,
Many seas,
Many oceans,
Many spings,
Many lakes,
Many waterfalls;
Concerning you and i!
Drink and live;
But, try to wake up from your sleep always.
Living!
In the land of love;
In the land of peace,
And, with the golden cup of care to serve one another!
But, concerning you and i.
The keys of life!
Living peacefully with one another to share in love;
Of the muse of life,
Camouflaged! !
Like the muse of the bulls in the forest.
Pills and beans!
Groundnuts and sugar;
Disco, discovery!
Looking at the ends of the world with your muse,
But, with the muse of joy.
