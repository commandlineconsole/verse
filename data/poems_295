A LOVE POEM
It is better to have loved and died
Than to survive
To carry the burden of love alone
Love is the face of pain
To which you run
Love is the hearth-fire
That destroys the house
And entombs the occupants
Love's flame cremates the self
And sublimates the soul
Love is the unshakable certainty
In the end of the world
Love makes the self removed
Destitute
Love makes the self embraced
Another
Love is the question
And love is the answer
Love is the destruction
And love is the creation
Love is the war
Between the heart and the mind
Love lasts forever
Lovers do not
