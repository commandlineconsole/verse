TIMELESS!
The hour is timeless
Still
Caught in a moment
A fire has been lit to the wick
of our Passions.
Our hearts smoldering with each smile
Each glance
The heat...It does increase
Our hearts cannot part
The fire is ablaze.
Caught up now in each others arms
The world outside does not matter
Engulfed in Each others Passions
Drenched in Each others Love
A Timeless Treasure we are living
A gift of each other to each other
Peter B LeBuhn
