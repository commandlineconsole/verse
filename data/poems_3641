A FOOL
I am a fool for  the Christ
Far as this world's concerned
But at the Rood of Calvary
Is where true wisdom is learned.
I am a fool for the Christ
When judged by other men
But I know my judge's name
He said it is 'HO ON'
I am a fool for the Christ
You may think so too
But could I ask one question;
Just, whose fool are you?
1 Corinthians 1: 18
From the Septuagint..'EGO EIMI HO ON'......'I AM THE BEING'
