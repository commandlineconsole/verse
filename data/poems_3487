AN UNLUCKY SOUL
Conceived in forbidden circumstances
Born and forsaken under forbidden circumstances
Brought up carelessly, confusing him and the lot
About his origin and future
Living a life of a perennial search
Unlikely to locate the needle in the hay stag
The blind search with no guide placing him in a precarious position
No one to hold his hand to cross the busy streets
He lost his only guide in a crash
Worsening the desperate search to puerile status
The search had to be reinitiated with no hope for success
Except the offering of a Samaritan,
Whoâ€™s concerned about his body not his mind
His soul in limbo, the angels calling for it
A complicated book to read again from beginning to end
Few concerns to read it nonchalantly as a newspaper
Destined for rubbish bin
Now he is in a state of loss and cold
More questions and answers for nobody to unravel
The angels are waiting for his soul
