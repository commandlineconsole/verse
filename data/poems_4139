FEAR
To shy to be myself
For i have the fear of being noticed
To sensitive to break a heart
For i have the fear of anger
To proud to say im sorry
For i have the fear of giving in
To curious to stand back and watch
For i have the fear of missing out
To weak to show my strengths
For i have the fear of envy
To embarresed to say what i feel
For i have the fear of mokery
To scared to be in love
For i have the fear of rejection
To worried about my health
For i have the fear of illness
To scared to do the wrong thing
For i have the fear of punishment
To dreamy to think about real life
For i have the fear of reality
But to sit down and write a poem
I have no fear of thoughts
