THE PILLOW OF DREAMS
The Pillow of Dreams
There lies
the fecund imagination of a maverick
scattered on the pillow
with blue, indigo and motley
vibrancy of night.
The morning sun
trickles through the window
and dissolves his inhibitions
and the webbed
cornucopia of delight.
Still,
there are some facets
of the invisible visions
that cling to him.
He yearns to retrograde
to what he beheld
during those listless hours
of sombre sleep.
(The author observes that dreams transport us into a make-believe realm of synthetic happiness and delight.)
