NO LONGER
i will no longer be a problem
once i live this cold earth,
taking away my life with me
stop asking questions and acting concerned
it would no longer matter whether you returned
a wet kiss on the cheek and a hug
is that what you think
will heal these painful cuts and painful memeories
a long day you say
of hard work and no pay,
no time for this problem
no time for you, your problem
i will no longer be a problem
once i live this cold earth
taking away my life with me
stop asking questions and acting concerned
i'll spare you, your time
wont take your breath
but after you blink
i will no longer be a problem
i will no longer be your problem
