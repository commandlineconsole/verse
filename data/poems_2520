A DOG IS GOOD
A deep ravine has beaten the love of a dog,
Chasms are fathomed by his imagination,
Lots of wood have blamed him with outbursts,
And the rubber of caves is deeming an outburst.
Mountains do tumble, and upend all because of his thinking;
I rather agree with the chill, and panting is easy,
Just far too easy, like a favourite living and wit.
Barking has outspread the anger,
As anger is intellectual for all the existence.
