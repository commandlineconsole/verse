WE CARE
In extreme mob, with suspiration and tear,
We are here to wipe off, because we care,
For the pain and worries that may turn you sear,
Don’t worry, we are here to aplomb, say we care,
In trouble and in depressive delusion veer,
Our smile, will vanish all, say we care,
You may unaware and in fear,
No matter, how it goes on, listen we care,
For ailment to sorrow and grief ere,
Spell the right, leave us to say we care,
In edgy situation, you won’t able to hear,
We whisper heart to heart, see we care,
Each remedy to final intervention till you wear,
We won’t leave you alone, feel we care,
And until you faith, contented and swear,
We keep on efforts, see we care.
