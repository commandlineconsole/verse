MY GREATEST FEAR!
I have many fears
some range from big to small
here's a secret dear
my greatest fear of them all
you might think it was to die
and yes long time ago it was
but now I enjoy the thought of my death
but let me tell you now my greatest fear of them all
is to become old and older going through menopause
become sick and ill until you no longer feel,
eyes always glazed do you see heaven through your haze?
painful streaks of pain that no medicine can contain
how can you keep your fate in god
when hes giving you all this pain?
but none the less this is my greatest fear
its not the thought of dying
its just the pain of old age
I don't want to be immortal
what a pain that would be!
but see it through my eyes
as you watch your grandmother slowly die
after all these years of pain
then you can understand my fear
is not death its slowly deterioration as i get old
so id rather die at 40 yeas old, young i know
but its peaceful that thought
my greatest fear my greatest fear my number one fear of them all!
