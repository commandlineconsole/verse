A NEW BREATH
A bundle of joy so grateful, dont know your name
i do know your a blessing, that gives each day
Abundle of joy so beautiful, dont kno how you look
i do know your a gift, that we could treassure and keep
A bundle of joy so pure, dont kno what you hate
i do know you come with love, that we will endlessly return forever
A bundle of joy so joyfull, dont know your smile
i do know your smile shimmers, that will brighten our days for enternity
a bundle of joy so anticipated, dont know your touch
i do know your an insipiration, that your touch shall bring out our Innocence.
A bundle of joy, your all ours...
tears will roll down when you take your first breath.
