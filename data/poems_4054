I LIVE IN FEAR
i live
in fear of dying
i walk in the streets,
in fear of being ran over
i sink in the water,
in fear of drowning
i staw away from you,
in fear of losing you
i cut myself,
in fear of bleeding
i destroy flowers,
in fear of getting tehm
i give away my heart,
in fear of having it stolen
i hate myself,
in fear of hating otehrs
i seclude myself,
in fear of being secluded by others
i kill myself,
in fear in fear
