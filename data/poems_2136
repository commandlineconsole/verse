THE COLD SHOULDER
The cold wind whispers in my ear
A melancholy tune I don’t want to hear
And I don’t have the strength to make it disappear
The cold rain is drowning me in all my sorrow
Don’t know why it couldn’t wait until tomorrow
When I could go looking for some courage to borrow
Why am I not surprise that you are a part of this
Turning my content world into eternal bliss
A show I definitely want to miss
If there is no joy in Mudville
Then everyone has had their fill
Of swallowing life’s’ little pill
I turn away from discretion
Common sense not my obsession
Who am I to seek your confession
The wind and the rain do their best
Of putting all my frailties to the test
To keep a storm brewing, never to rest
I cannot see a season of change
And civility is out of range
Loneliness a companion not so strange
Why am I not surprised that it came to this
To not seal the deal when there was no way I could miss
Who am I to wish for  one last kiss
