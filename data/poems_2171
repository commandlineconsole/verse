PAPER FLOWERS
The voices, they whisper,
so soft and pretty.
Their words are riddles,
keen and witty.
Catching me by surprise
Masked by a clever guise
Hiding behind sounds
of a gentle ditty.
When darkness falls,
they come to play
Dancing with joy,
they swear to stay.
They haunt and taunt me
Laughing with such glee
Screaming in pain,
I tell them 'Go away! '
The voices still whisper,
so soft a ditty.
Their words, not riddles,
are far from witty.
No longer do they surprise
Cannot hide with a guise
They sing me songs,
to gain my pity.
