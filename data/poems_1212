FIRE
Dancing children sway with pure delight,
they move before my very sight.
the light, the heat they do show
warms my heart I love them so.
They are so needed on a cold spring day,
to warm the heart and keep winter at bay.
their crackling call, the embers glow
their dance hypnotic
before my sight the children dance
with such delight
