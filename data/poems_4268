I FEAR
I fear
That you'll leave me,
And never come back.
I fear
That if you come back,
You won't remeber me.
I fear
That if you don't remeber me,
You wont love me anymore.
I fear
That if you don't love me anymore,
There is no reason for me.
I fear
That if there is no reason for me,
You wont miss me.
