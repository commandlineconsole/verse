OVERCAME THE ENEMY
I look at my past and see
Fear was my one true enemy
Living life behind a veil
Finding all the decisions where made for me
Some where good and others not so
There are some the make me proud
These are ones where the enemy was
I overcame the enemy of fear
Acting only as I wanted to
Taking the ruff road
Making my self stronger
Placing fear behind me
Not knowing what was near
Finding that conquering fear
That overcoming fear makes my pride
And when you have pride it makes you
HAPPY!
