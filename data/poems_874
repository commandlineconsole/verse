STRATOSPHERE OF JOY
He whose life that is not well spend,
Have not yet reached the stratosphere,
His mind is not completely bend
That the joy of life is at the end,
But once in his life, he shall go here,
And be with us in the stratosphere.
In May, when sunshine arise
The droppeth of fear subside;
Inter-relating with the God
In the stratosphere of joy,
Where gloominess is out of sight,
And only joyfullness reigns;
Yet amidst the life, He once thought,
That theres no stratosphere of joy,
But now, openminded he is,
He now know he can exist,
In the stratosphere of joy
And dance with glee and joy.
