SWEET DREAMS
I am getting tired
Feel like sleeping
Yes, I am going to my loneliness
However, not before saying goodnight to anyone, who cares about me
Even though, I am not sure if anyone does care
Sweet dreams to all the sweet people
Spreading love is better as hate only hurts you back.
Anyone who does care, I love you and wish the best for you, till my last breath
So, please accept my good night as I do wish to love and care
Sweet Dreams to you, with my soulful love
Not cheating you, simply loving you with my heart.
