GO AWAY
No one noticed sun rise
No one took note of moon's surprise
Eclipsed remain for short time
We carried on our routine in time
Why to concern for natural mystery
What have we to do with its history?
It may come daily and go
We need not concern and unnecessarily blow
Remain unconcerned for whatever reason?
But stay not aloof as very good person
You are here for specific stay
Do some good before you depart or go away
