BLACK AND BLUE
Last beams have fallen to the ground.
Evening crawls through the empty street,
And mixes your thoughts and knocks you down..
All what you want, all what you need -
Somebody to care
Somebody who cares
Somebody alive in the monochrome universe
Who will stay
Even when he leaves
Who's brave enough to change life's course
I found new lie, I crushed my dreams.
Im getting drunk with hope and greed
The hell I care what evening brings
And all I want and all I need -
Somebody to care
Somebody who cares
Somebody alive in the monochrome universe
Who will stay
Even when he leaves
Who's brave enough to change life's course
Everything's painted in blue
I lost myself in the slowly stream
Driving me to the night and hiding all clues
I need it so much, I wanna scream
Somebody to care
Somebody who cares
Somebody alive in the monochrome universe
Who will stay
Even when he leaves
Who's brave enough to change life's course
Somebody black, somebody blue.
