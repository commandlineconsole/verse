SORROW
Watching and listening all around,
People are hurting and there frowns are larger than a mountain,
That I could once climb upon.
When sorrow knocks on your door,
Sorrow can't not take you far.
She won't give a free ride to,
Anywhere you ought to be.
Oh tell me.
What do you do when you think you own nothing and,
Your emotions are thumping through the floor?
Take your hands out of your pockets,
Look into your self and find the answers are already inside.
When sorrow is at your door,
Sorrow can't not take you far.
She won't give a free to,
Anywhere you ought to be.
When you feel the pain,
Know that it isn't you to blame.
Itâ€™s the puppets outside playing tricks on you!
Know yourself well enough,
To believe that problem isn't you.
