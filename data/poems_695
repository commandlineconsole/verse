JOY ARRIVES
Joy arrives
Joy dances and swirls
Joy given freely to those whom will accept this gift
The joy of living ones' life within the realm of freedom
A childs' joy untampered with and left to be experienced honestly
Yes, an honest joy
Free of hinderences
Free of doctrines
Free of definitions
Free to be expressed and experienced by all willing
Yes,  joy born in freedom
Joy born in love
Joy given and taken freely
A  joy that comes to visit
A joy that arrives to you this day, this moment
A joy to be shared
A joy in living and a living paid in the currency of joy
Be joyful this day
Be joyful this moment
Come to the joy of this moment
Arrive and depart in joy
Let joy make a home within your heart.
Allow joy this day
Now
Now, have we joy
