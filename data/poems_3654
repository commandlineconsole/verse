MINE, AN EYE FOR DETAIL
Wonderful how
hours slip unnoticed,
settling into this familiar position,
i've skimmed these old notebooks,
cover to cover,
seems a thousand times now,
surprising even myself
with this corsage of fragments
gathered as if i'd intended so
all along,
and my god-
there must be a dozen
scattered lines
concerning just those
blackboard skies.
Funny, i can recall
even the earliest moments
and feeling somehow
as if you'd masked
some polished secret
from an anxious world:
Snapshots, at best, from a bronze world,
movement never quite so magestic
(although from my perspective,
so clear to see) .
