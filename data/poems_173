LOVES AND LOVERS
I’ve seen many loves and many lovers
Many happy endings that after a while you discover
I’ve seen loves in a mist of war
And I’ve seen loves painting their faces with forget
I’ve seen loves always asking for more
And loves whose faces scream regret
I’ve seen loves that try
And I’ve seen loves that wait
I’ve seen loves you buy
And loves that send a vibe of hate
I’ve seen loves that lose
And I’ve seen lovers that are lost
I’ve seen lovers that soon refuse
And I’ve seen loves when they pay the cost
I’ve seen loves that give
I’ve seen loves that take
I’ve seen lovers that forgive
And loves that stay together for another’s sake
I’ve seen loves so warm
Loves that at any time can turn
Loves that need reform
And loves that at times could burn
I’ve seen loves so strange
Loves that could never change
I’ve seen loves that end in failure
I’ve seen loves that seem a success
I’ve seen loves that are hardly started,
That are on a road to destruction Via express
I’ve seen loves lacking sight
I’ve seen loves with their light burning bright
I’ve seen loves almost ready to strike
But I’ve also seen loves that are only in like.
