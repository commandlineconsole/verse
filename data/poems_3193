IN MY SORROWS,
In my sorrows,
In my sorrows,
In my afflictions,
In my religion and beliefs,
There is more than  that,
That Love is the Conquer,
Love is the son,
Love is the making of a real woman,
Mouth is the making of a Man,
Truth is the making of covenant for Humanity,
Nice is that we are all lovely creatures.
