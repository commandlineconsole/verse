YOU ARE AT THE CENTER
You are at the center of love.
O my dear, You are for me
I am for You.
We are related with each other
O my dear, eternal relationship
Is here and we are far from fear.
Love is our goal love is our perfection
Love is our life love is our education
We are in love and nothing but love.
Our life is the platform of love
