WHAT'LL WE DO ABOUT US?
We took care of our financial obligations,
We took care of parental visitations.
We took care of our property rights,
We took care of so very much…
But, what’ll we do about us?

We took care of all the litigation,
We took care of all the aggravation.
We took care of telling our friends,
We took care of calling the bluff…
But, what’ll we do about us?

We took care of material things,
We took care of our wedding rings.
We took care of the life that was,
We took care of the marriage stuff…
But, what’ll we do about us?
What’ll we do about the love we gave?
What’ll we do about the vows we made?
What’ll we do about happy ever after?
What’ll we do about making it forever?
What’ll we do about us?

Yeah, we took care of most everything,
We took care of our hopes and dreams;
But there's one thing we didn't think of...
That’s, what’ll we do about us?
Baby…
What’ll we do about us?

Author’s notes:
Many couples think that they will be happy if they separate or divorce. Maybe that is true for some. But, after they get through fighting it out in court, dealing with child custody battles, dividing up material possessions, then what?
I have spoken to many who have said, after it was all over and done, 'What was I thinking about? '
I hope you enjoy, Loyd
