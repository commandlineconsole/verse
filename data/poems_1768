DOWN HER BREASTING BRIDGE AND SLOPE
Wall her within those rooms filled with forbidden rights
Cherishing one last hope of an ordained conscious
Abandon her clothes in the hallway or let her choose
The sacred eyes of her sex as she spreads the blues
Touch her tender pain and wonder why you abuse her waist
Poured out the cups in her pleasure, lay her body as well
At her hands of what milks all of her dying men
Very well: if this is but her pleasure, a captivated victim to be
