BRAVE PASSION
Brave passion whose fire
is quenched by another’s reason.
The journey to the light of love
is consumed with agendas.
Other paths and presentations
dim and darken the way.
He’s angry who does not
find an easy path to joy
chance might place
within an easy grasp
one whom she can persuade.
Knowing pain and pleasure
at passion’s passing.
Thy love is a binding treat,
It is as wiley as a wood nymphs
path one attempts its capture.
For more than a span of time
Beings run wild to attain it
Kisses grown cold from lack of use
Heat quickly when love’s embrace
lights the embers of desire.
Brave passion thee are not
forgotten only left to glide
In space between duty and desire.
For the span of day let passion reign
and reason chase duty to the edge
of reason’s blessed disaster.
