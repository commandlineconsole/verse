EVERYONE WAS THERE
Thinking about senior year
Everyone was here
Playing capture the flag at the park
Didn’t stop ‘til it got dark
And the very next day
Had poison on my arms and legs
And I didn’t even care
Because everyone was there
We were young and stupid
We were wild and crazy
But we didn’t even care
Because everyone was there
Thinking about that one Saturday
Was having fun in our own way
At a friends house we were spending the night
Think that was true? Yeah right
We were partying hard in the field
If my parents found out I’d be killed
But I didn’t even care
Because everyone was there
We were young and stupid
We were wild and crazy
But we didn’t even care
Because everyone was there
Thinking about graduation night
We were all as high as a kite
Laughing about the whole year
And we were all here
Sitting around a bonfire
With a bottle of fire water
And I didn’t even care
Because everyone was there
We were young
And we were so stupid
We were wild
And we were so crazy
We didn’t have a worry or a care
Because everyone was there
