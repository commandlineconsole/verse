A KISS
Passion as was the fruit
Upon his lips
Sweet juices from thy lips
As passion slid
Toward uplifting bliss
Has these nights of heated kiss
Have troubled within wanton bliss
As your lust lies within me as we lie
In fantasy
Hear your heart to trust what's there
For I shall not fall away from your retreat
To slumber sleep.
