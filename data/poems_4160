FEAR WITHIN MY PAIN
what is fear?
how can you tell if you're afraid...
till the other night i thought that i feard nothing
but i do fear
within my pain
i am afraid of something that is not clear to me,
why do i fear something thats unknown to me
fear what is fear...
when i used to fear something i faced it
but i do not know what i fear i just feel afraid
i havent had a good nightssleep in days
even weeks
but why
i can not help but think
why fear, fear does not show weakness
but yet im weak
i can not face more days with this pain,
let along with this fear
