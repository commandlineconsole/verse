THE FAIRIES
Away from human prying eyes
Away from sorrow and surprise
They walk
Delicate fragile wings of light
Alone at dawn, and here at night
They walk
Sweet breath, and dainty faces
From close and farther places
They walk
With pointed ears and elfin pace,
With fine-tuned, never ending grace
They walk
They dance and dance to fairy tune
Happy under the light of moon
They walk
They’re pilgrims, they were born to run
And with as much as laughter, fun
They walk
Unearthly beings of crystal beauty
Fulfil responsibility, and duty
They walk
They’re guardians, protectors of the realm
Beneath the shadow of the elm
They walk
Away from human, prying eyes,
Away from sorrow and surprise
They walk
