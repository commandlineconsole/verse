LOVE; SACRED AND SECRETS.
When was the first time you hear one say i love you?
How did it sound?
Love, love, love, love.
Just like a band.
When was the time love was renounced?
How did it start?
Love, love, love, love.
Just like a right.
When was the time love tell a lie?
How did it lie?
Love, love, love, love.
like Ananias.
When was the time love lived in the heart?
How did it survive?
Love, love, love, love.
like the christ.
When was the time love got baptised?
How did she vow?
I love, i do, i am
in love and now.
