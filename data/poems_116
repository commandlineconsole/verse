SO THAT ALL WE HEAR IS THE CHIRP OF A LONELY BIRD
Some Crazy thing inside told me money is what anyone would want
Or some Material thing you could easily flaunt
But inside an emotionless place
I found something money could never replace
I kind of realized I have something to tell you
Something I know you knew
But even if you know
Here I go:
I love you how a fat boy likes cake
How the Earth loves the sun when it wakes
I love you how the stars love the moon
How Indians love the Monsoon
I love you how coffee loves sugar and cream
I love you how pillows love a good dream
I love you how fans love their team
I love you how a little boy loves his new scheme
I love you how plants love the light
I love you how the winds love a kite
I love you how a library loves books
I love you how haters love giving dirty looks
I love you like clouds love the sky
I love you how tears love a good cry
I love you how hell loves a bad deed
I love you how a car loves the speed
I love you how trump loves his money
I love you how bees love their honey
I love you how a rainbow loves color
I love you how a kid loves to grow an inch taller
I love you how the Mets love to lose
I love you more than I love my shoes
I love you more than I love video games
I love how a fire loves its flames
I love you how you hate yellow
How a little girl somewhere loves Jell-O
I love you more than I will ever tell you face to face
More than any disagreement could ever erase
I love you how my lips will never be able to say
I love you like everything of everyday
If someday you say I love you
Inside, I’m shouting “I love you too”
Even if I hide it with a smile
Even if it takes a while
You will see that I don’t need words to say I love you anyway
Imagine if someday someway someone takes these words away
Then will we just have no way to say?
More than words is what I need
So my silence does not mislead
So that all you hear is the chirp of a lonely bird
And finally know I love you, without me saying a word.
