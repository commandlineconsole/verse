LOVE
Love is a passion
Love is a potion
Love is a poison
Love is easy but
Love is leave to hard
Love is hard
Love makes me deep feeling to heart
Love makes me laugh
Love makes me cry
Love makes me stand
Love makes me fall
Love is all of the above
but love is also
but love is understandable
unstable in my soul
So why can't love
why does not love to his 'Honey'
just be easy
to handle...
but sometime not to be
easy to handle the love
