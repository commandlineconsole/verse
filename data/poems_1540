THAT TASTE
that taste is fresh
that taste is cool and sweet to my lips
that taste is remarkable
the tone and gesture is real
the touch is smooth and black like almonds
the touch is clear to my grasp
the touch the taste upon my taste glands
that taste is remarkable
the pleasure to know
the pleasure to feel it
the pleasure to want to taste more and more of it
the taste is remarkable
the sunny glaze of honey dew melons
the sunny country side is there
the sunny touch makes me quever
the taste is so, so, so, remarkable
the taste of you
the taste of you
the taste....
