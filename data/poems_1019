TREMENDOUS ASCENSION
Calm wonder of the night
Has made love seem well tight.
Before me, a fair sight
Released joy, which took flight.
That great joy ascends right
From the heart that goes bright
With heavenly soft light.
Its effect great, not slight
To the tremendous height
With love that cannot blight,
Fills my soul with great might.
Such joy with that I plight.
