THE PARTING SONG
Farewell nooks and cranies
Of elysian blissful land
Farewell friends and foes
Dwelling and indwelling upon this plain
For we have drank to our fill
And made for merriment the wine
We have not made our drink offering's
High heaven's would thunder
In resentful delight
We have swayed thousands in thoughts
And increased our arms with strength
Stronger than the might of the AJAX
And fiercer than DIOMED-son of Tydeus
We've filled in sacks-men's blood
And forgot the heaven up high
Ne'er did miss so much delight
Deem it not blissful to stand anymore
Farewell ancient mischief
The anger comes sooner from high heavens
Fare-well you who stay
For in entirety i see no more
Than in a ship upon far Aegian sea
