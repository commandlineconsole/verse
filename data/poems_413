LOVE ME ONCE
oh my love,
love me once,
once like you loved,
loved me with passion,
passion which was so intense,
intense was your desire,
desire which was so strong,
strong was your craving,
craving which is now missing,
missing is the passion,
the passion is all i need,
i need is your love,
Love! love me once,
once like the way you loved.
