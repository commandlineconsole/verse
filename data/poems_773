HOPE AGAINST HOPE
Hope against all hope
That times will change
A word lingers
In time and place
Softly spoken
Memories bring joy
Memories bring tears
Hope against hope
That love will grow
From the embers
A single spark
Lights the fire again
Memories bring joy
Memories bring tears
Hope against hope
Time will soften
A hardened heart
A fractured mind
Bring peace to soul
Memories bring joy
Memories bring tears
Hope against hope
That this is Â a dream
I will wake soon
Covered in sweat
Breathing once again
Memories bring joy
Memories bring tears
Hope against hope
That tomorrow is different
Today didn't happen
But it did
Can't change today
Memories bring tears
