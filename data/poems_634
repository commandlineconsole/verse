STRANGER
This woman that I see, staring from my mirror
Unknown longing in her heart, forbidden love in her soul,
Where has the one I've known gone, when did you take her place
Please help me understand, this passion deep inside
How long befor he knows, how long can we hide
Copletely by surprise the passion has grown so strong
I can not figure out, just where I belong
