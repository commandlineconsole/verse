SADNESS TOO INTENSE
Sadness too intense and deep
Can shatter the mind and eliminate
Vital memories:
Memories of fist kisses,
Romantic rendezvous’ in the moonlight
When love was new,
Wedding bells, children’s birthdays,
And important anniversaries,
Memories of who you really are
When you’re stripped of superficial facades
Of position and prominence
And have to discover anew
Something redeeming in your personality
To pull you through.
Sadness from an overwhelming
Sense of unexpected loss
Caused by death or divorce
Can remove not only memories
But even concepts of right and wrong and truth.
