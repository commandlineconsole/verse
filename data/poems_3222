MISERY CHAIN
Why is life full of pain,
sorrow, guilt, and remorse?
When yet there is nothing to gain
but education of the mistakes we endorse.
Still, nothing evil fades
nor good ever remains.
Even after we learn
temptation does return.
And the fool who once slipped
falls once again
And then...
Over it all began.
The guilt, sorrow, pain,
and the misery chain.
