REFLECTION
The sorrow of my life
Reflects sadness in my eyes
The pain of living
So intense the sky itself begins to cry
With a down pour of rain
To try to wash away the pain
The pain a darker color than Black
Gives a new definition of darkness
Clings to my heart
To reflect my life
Forever to stay
Forever to show
My lige in the shadows
Hidden form the light
Unable to retain my sanity
I am lost in the shadows
That surrounds my entire being
With a sadness reflecting in my eyes
