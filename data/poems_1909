'CRYING LADY'
Tears is an emotional mark
that reveals true feelings
of an innate expression
of either sadness or joy
We are all vulnerable
to stimuli around us
we react to all actions
we encounter each day
We are surprise by events
that we have not expected
either it entail good or bad vibe
somehow it enthuse an expression
A colleague of good standing
had cried when caught in awe
when we prepared a surprise party
to celebrate her sixty one birthday
She was grateful of our gift
her tears signified the joy
which she never expected
that we care for her as friend
