IDO NOT SAY I LOVE YOU
I do not say I love you
Because I really love you
I do not say I care for you
Because I really care for you
I do not say I understand you
Because I really understood you
I do not say I respect you
Because I really respect you
I do not say I will be with you whenever you need me
Because I am already and always with you
I do not say I need you
Because I really need you
I do not say I will meet you
Because I never leave you
I do not say I miss you
Because I know you are ever with me
I do not say I share your concern
Because I take your concerns as mine
I do not say I will give everything for you
Because I have nothing except you as mine
I do not say many such things to you
As I run short of words
When I venture saying similar things to you
