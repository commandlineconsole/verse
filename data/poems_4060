LESSONS OF LIFE
i feared being alone
until i learned to like myself
i feared failure
until i realized that i only fail when i don't try
i feared success
until i realized that i had to try in order to be happy with myself
i feared people's opinions
until i learned that peolple would have opinions about me anyway
i feared rejection
until i learned to have faith in myself
i feared pain
until i learned that it's necessary for growth
i feared the truth
until i saw the ugliness in lies
i feared death
until i realized that it's not an end but a beginning
i feared my destiny
until i realized that i had the power to change my life
i feared hate
until i saw that it was nothing more than ignorance
i feared love
until it touched my heart, making the darkness fade into endless sunny days
i feared ridicule
until i learned how to laugh at myself
i feared growing old
until i realized that i gained wisdom every day
i feared the future
until i realized that life just kept going better
i feared the past
until i realized that it could no longer hurt me
i feared the dark
until i saw the beauty of starlight
i feared the light
until i learned that the truth would give me strength
i feared change
until i saw that even the most beautiful butterfly had to undergo a metamorphosis before it could fly
