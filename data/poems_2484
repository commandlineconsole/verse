UNTITLED
Hands to hit,
Hands to hurt,
Hands to break
Without even touching.
Eyes to see,
Eyes to stare,
Eyes to weep
Over the missing.
Rage to crush,
Rage to condemn,
Rage to burn,
Without even seeing.
Loss to empty,
Loss to consume,
Loss to despair,
Whilst never knowing.
Grief to denial,
Denial to anger,
Anger to acceptance,
But never forgetting.
