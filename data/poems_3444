A FOUNTAIN SPRING OF LOVE!
No perfect tragedy has occurred yet;
But everybody seems to have lost interest!
Is it due to monotony or no sense of humanity?
Silent sad music of society reminds me of Nature
That has become dry and beauty less everywhere
Reflecting the trend of society now suffering everywhere!
When  the recovery will take place know not!
But still believe Nature never leaves one in despair
Provided all should stop exploiting and destroying Nature!
Can any human hearted people do harm to love
Whose out going concern is genuine for the well being of all
In the world many are concerned only with me, myself and I only?
With empathy and sympathy towards the simple loving souls
One can actually find genuine love springing as in a fountain ever!
