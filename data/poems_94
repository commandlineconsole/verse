LOVE
Love is not a color
love is not a game
love is just a feeling
love is really lame
Love will make you smile
love will make you cry
love will confuse you
love will make you ask why
Love can be a good thing
love can really suck
love depends on your man
love depends on luck
Love is really stupid
love makes me want to die
love might come to an end
love will then make you cry
Love has no point
love is just him pretending
love is what I hate
love has no freaking ending
