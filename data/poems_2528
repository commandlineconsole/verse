NEW MOON
Middle of earth,
Stood a huge palace,
From which a girl came glidingly,
Her delicacy made her angel in herself,
She was alive but buried inside the walls of fort,
Chained with jewels and pearls,
Like a bird in a golden cage,
A week past seven days she used to come walking through an unbuilt door,
In search of freedom but in the boundaries of kingdom,
She goes to the quite sea shore,
To see the sun down and to take a piece of breath,
Singing with her resonant voice,
The voice which crossed the seven skies calling the god to make her free
The waves which ever never heard now arised with angriness against god,
Her pitty eyes filled with emotions,
Faded with dusk,
Her tear like pearls scattered on earth,
Made the earth shame,
She began returning to her prison,
Passing through the lane of trees where they shed their leaves to praise her,
The rays of the moon now touched the earth,
Which were hidden under the shadow of earth,
Feeling shy from the beauty of the princess,
Someday, somewhere, someoneâ€™s soul has to leave,
More over to princess even she lost her soul,
The whole macrocosm,
Was filled with sorrow,
It seemed the earth was shaken,
Thunders clapped with angriness,
The moon was cursed to smudge himself in order not to be praised over,
In remembrance of her,
The earth was said to repeat the same what happened when princess came out
And till now it is repeating,
And will repeat till trumpets blow.
