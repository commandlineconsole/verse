THE WAY
Each and every day
Brings enough joy and gay
Pleasure and pain, not to say
Also makes a brief stay
Whenever you are caught in fray
There always appears a flash of ray
Pray not to turn the ray gray
For all the hard work you pay
Can’t easily be taken away
But don’t get carried away
Keep in mind what they say
Where there is will, there is a way.
*Every day brings several joyful moments, mixed with pleasure and pain. By holding a strong will to succeed, we can definitely find a way to come out of tight situations.
