SWEET SORROW
O Darkness of mine,
Why do they maltreat you?
O Sorrow so kind,
What is it you do?
How cruel they are,
to make Sorrow cry!
How cruel they are,
to leave Darkness looking up at the sky!
Why is Sorrow such a malady?
Who left Darkness in disarray?
He longs to live in sweet Sorrow's golden morrow,
even if it pierces like an arrow.
