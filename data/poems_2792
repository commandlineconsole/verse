DROWNING IN SORROWS
Drowning in sorrows once again can’t reach the shore
Keeping my head above water has become such a chore
Sadness has started slipping in, weighing me down
A dim light at the top, I have to fight it, can’t let me drown
Oh please somebody throw me a rope, I can’t swim
Each caught up in their own life, looks very grim
Water of life getting warmer, starting to feel numb
Got to fight this, maybe change the outcome
I’ve finally reached the shore, the sadness has past
Maybe tomorrow, a happiness that can last!
