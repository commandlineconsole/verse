NO ANSWER
i said goodbye to shady
i guess now it's your turn
i've came each time you called
you held my love and my concern
i always said if you need me, just call
i'll be there as soon as i can
i'll pick you up and brush you off
and not leave until you're able to stand
'you'll miss me when i'm gone'
yet how easily you say goodbye
you tell me what i want to hear
i listen knowing it's all a lie
i only wanted to help you
for you to lean on when in need
you pushed me when i got too close
and drained me with your greed
i don't have anything left to give
you've taken all i've got
my love, concern, and security
and you've forgotten all i taught
i taught you to trust in me
i taught you to believe
never did i think it would be me
that you'd choose to deceive
you were my brother, my lover, my friend
we were an awesome team
but it was an impossible relationship
and now it'd be hard to redeem
you hurt me really bad this time
this time you pushed and i fell
you ripped the heart right out my chest
as the tears in my eyes begin to swell
there is no easy way to tell you
but i had given you my all
next time there won't be an answer
to your 'i need you' call
