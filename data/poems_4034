FEAR
fear fear fear your not my friend
fear fear fear you are the end
fear fear fear will you ever cease?
fear will consume
fear will kill
because we kill out of fear
fear is a killer
fear tears us apart slowly and painfully
fear will never cease
because fear is unexpected
and fear will kill us all
but fear can be conquered
only by brave souls
