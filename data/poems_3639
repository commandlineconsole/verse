MY KIND OF HERO
Will, with unassuming dignity &
steadfast dedication
Perform small miracles each day
His ego does not thirst for
selfish gain, or
Undisciplined applause
He quietly supports the weak,
the helpless
The life-enhancing cause
His motive is real concern for
the distraught
He is not moved by wealth or
glory
He is not bought.
