THE MIRROR TELLS THE TALE
I look into the mirror
but all I see
looking back at me
it sadness
I look into the mirror
but all I see
looking back at me
is tears
I look into the mirror
but all I see
looking back at me
is nothing
I look into the mirror
but all I see
looking back at me
is scars
I look into the mirror
and I realize
that all I am
is sadness, tears, and scars
a nothing
