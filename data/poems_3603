A TOZ, AZAD
A to Z, AZAD
(For Humayun Azad)
Ratan Kumar Saha Roy

To live and let live
is a philosophical word today
which minced with butcher’s knives
something is dying in us and
we watch in bewilderment

We thought the world
or at least our corner of it
could be made
it not better
at least less bad.

Some simple lessons of civilization:
Ballot-Box democracy is meaningless
without monocracy.

To say there is no world
But what we make with words
And what we call truth
is only a construct.
To be Azad, to be free
to walk, talk, write, sing
love, draw, dance
is the A to Z of life
the rest is Death
Death, death, death.
I’m not concerned here with poetry
The poetry is in the protest.
