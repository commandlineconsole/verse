VESTIGIAL HOPE
I am hesitant to go too far too fast
To repeat not only the good, but the failures of the past
I struggle to find words to describe, not only the love I have,
but also the surreptitious fear that I hide
I fear your dulcet words come too easily
I fear your heart speaks in the absence of context
in the candor of only the moment
so I love with forbearance instead of
a love that comes gushing from me
I fear my heart is too broken to trust you implicitly
I fear that I fear unrest less than stability;
that I evoke trouble and harbor misfortune
I fear that we started this romance too late,
but that we had loved each other too soon
I fear that I will love you just to lose you again
and thereby lose my worth which rests on you now
I fear my need is more than you should care to shoulder
and that my gifts are much less than you deserve
I fear your redolent love is more than my vestigial hope
