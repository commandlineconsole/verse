SURCEASE FROM SHINING
[4/22/08]
eyes begin watching
concerned and afraid
eyes grow troubled
worried and grave
a bolt of lightning
strikes home with a flash
and those eyes are shot open
as comprehending thoughts clash
the room starts to spin
and her stomach is sick
her body collapses
as if she's been kicked
her crumpled frail limbs
sink to the earth's floor
long ago her heart was broken
now her heart exists no more
she knows she is losing
losing it all
but she just keeps choosing
to play pretend through the fall
she's watching Loss stalking
sneaking ever near
the words she's speaking
are uttered in fear
a bright dying star
is reflected in her eyes
she wishes so damn far
while floods of tears are cried
then she's rendered voiceless
by a suffocating distress
her paranoia leaves her anguished
she can't escape this torment
her heart wavers
her body trembles
she's struck with a lost feeling
though her world
seems
to be healing
cold and alone
reaching for someone to hold
grasping thin, empty air
her eyes a dark, desperate stare
irreversibly damaged
by this blatant rejection
she drifts off to sleep
to a dreamland so sweet
