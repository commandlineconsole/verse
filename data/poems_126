LOVE
Love is like a rainbow, so bright and happy
Love is like a rain storm, so dark and sad
Love is a word
Love Is a way you feel
Love is whar you show to someone you care
Love may lie
Love is sometimes real
Love may never stay steel
Love can come
Love can go
Love may not know its love
Love can last forever
Love can last a day
Love can say nothing
Love can say everything
Love is how you expres yourself
Now that truly what love is
