NOBODY CARES
Nobody cares about the way i feel
Nobody cares about the pain people suffer
Nobody cares about children who get hurt
Nobody cares if the world isnt a happy place
Nobody cares if i cant control my fears
Nobody cares if i cry myself to sleep
Nobody cares if angels look after you
Nobody cares about animals being treat wrongly
Nobody cared when i needed someone to talk to
Nobody cared when all i wanted was peace
Nobody cares about how life goes on
Nobody cares! ! !
Will people stop war?
Will people stop the hate?
Would you stop to think and CARE?
God only knows
And time will tell
