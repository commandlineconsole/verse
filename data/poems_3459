SUNDAYS
The day of my death
Shall be a Sunday.
Some entitled Christian insider
I'm not, but
Only on Sunday
Am I alivest and best.
Other days I'm half lost
Though hardly concerned.
Sunday is the Christian's
Unintended gift of freedom:
When young and wild, Sundays
Were a blur of beer, bear hugs and other drugs.
Strange impossible intimacies.
Now, I savour the day, the weather, the light.
My children: I hug them.
I touch every strand of hair.
In every room,
I sit and feeel each passing minute.
A silent demonstration of the miracle
Of breath.
Tomorrow I go to work.
I'm hardly concerned.
Today,
I held hands with time
And there was no fear.
