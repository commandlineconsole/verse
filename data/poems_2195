ANGER IS A STRONG BURNING POISON OF LIFE
Anger is a strong burning poison of life
A brave man easily controls his anger,
In every walk of life it brings us danger,
Even though it divorces husband and wife,
Angry men and women lose  consciousness,
They fight and fight wildly without thinking,
Good hearts are disturbed in deep sinking,
It makes them to argue in unconsciousness,
In anger a son tears the shirt of his father,
And his father angrily runs to the police-station,
To see this incident many people may gather,
They laugh and say, what an insulting situation!
Grandmother shouts, anger is a hot weather,
Anger, Anger, Anger, my son stop your destruction.
