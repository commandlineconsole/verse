>>>I KNOW WHAT  LOVE IS!
I know what seeing is!
As I saw you that  day for the first time
So I know what liking is!
I know what striking is!
As I stroke stone against stone
So I know what the spark is!
I know what rubbing  is!
As I rubbed heart against heart
So I know what  love is!
I know what  caring is!
As I had been used to it since we met
So I know what  soft touch is!
I know what  fire is!
As I had been burning along with you
So I know what nectar is!
I know what compassion is!
As I have experienced it   with you
So I know what affection is!
I know what addiction is!
As I have been addicted to the smell of you
So I know what obsession is!
I know what memory is!
As I have  experienced the break up
So I know what the hurt is!
I know what mistake is!
As I have been the victim of misjudgement
So I know what reconciliation is!
I know what longing is!
As I have  suffered from emptiness
So I know what she is!
I know what losing is!
As I have  lost in the rough wind
So I know what I miss!
