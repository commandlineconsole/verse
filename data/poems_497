OVERCONSIDERATION ROSE TO CODIAL IGNORANCE
Overconsideration rose to cordial ignorance,
lies never,
but the passion of passion which passion endows,
now diverging,
sad and unforgiving;
there is no limit to how far apart we can drift.
Tether hard,
tackle separation now,
the sadness background looms,
love came about, and went, and came,
returns always,
perpetually futile, paradoxical,
never enough,
never enough,
enough of never love!
Leaving now,
I depart from it,
leaving it behind.
