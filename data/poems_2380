DEATH, ANGER, SILENCE.
For years I've been trying to evade it
And I thought I'd finally succseeded
But the blackness just keeps crawling in
deadly, Â angry, silent.
The road that I walk down is long
And I'm not really sure where it goes
But I keep walking, trying to hide
From the death, anger and silence
It starts out as a shadow
Nothing but a little blocked light
Except soon I'm surrounded; I can't get out
Of the death, anger and silence
As the shadow grows big, I become small
Blending in, hidden from one and all
To make myself seen I have to scream
And make death, anger and silence
I look around, I look around,
Trying to find simewhere safe
But soon I see, it becomes clear to me;
You can't  stop the death
You can't hide from the anger
And you can't escape the silence
