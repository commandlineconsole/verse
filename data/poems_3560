PRINCESS
Little dream
Concerning him
I always adored
And explored
The chance to avail and see
With all kind of wishes to be feel free
Make prince of my desire
Look at him and always admire
I awake at midnight
With interruption in dream every night
He stands tall in my eye
How can I forget to try?
He may come one day
On white horse to take me away
In his dreamland
I shall still stare and stand
I am little princess
With no worldly access
I wish to be wed in royal state
Where all people wish us and salute
I would love charitable work
Donate enough and promise words
That no one will be hungry ever
I shall remain on their side with enough care
