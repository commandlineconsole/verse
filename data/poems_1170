MIRROR
Kissed the mirror in delight
the beauty that shows ever alike
fixed mirror never move
and moving figures decor with vigour..
Mirror again smiled and thanked God!
Oh!  God! Thank you for ever
reflecting the physical decor
let the inner conscious never shown
and inner thoughts conceal behind
let the aura and physical reflections shine
let them kiss me in delight for ever....
