FEAR
Oh my dear let me tell you a story about fear
When we stop listening to the voice of our conscious
When we refuse to see the world within
When the noises inside begin to hound us
Then we begin to see fear around us
When the shadow of doubt creeps in
When the seed of jealousy seeps in
When the foot prints of defeat hold sway
Then we let fear have its way
When we don't do what is to be done
Behold defeat is its son
When we let hate inside the door
When on the wings of despondency we sore
Fear begins to engulf us more and more
When we take relationships for granted
When towards our maker we turn our back
Fear is sure to make its attack
When we take more then we give
Fear within us begins to live
When we stop taking the bull by the horn
Then fear within us is born
When the line of wrong and right begins to blur
Fear within us begins to stir
When we give up without a fight
Fear is bound to give us a fright
When we loose all hope
In the clouds of fear we begin to mope
So ye seeker take heed
Bring in love within your heart
Because only love can drive away fear
Never to bring it near
