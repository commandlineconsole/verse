YOU
You're the only guy I see
That's truly right for me
You're the only guy in my eyes
What a big surprise
You're the only one that understands
Everywhere that my heart lands
Everything I write about is true
But mostly about you
You might be surprised
But in my eyes
You're the only guy I see
That's truly right for me
