NOTHING I WRITE CAN SAY/ THE SADNESS I FEEL
NOTHING I WRITE CAN SAY/ THE SADNESS I FEEL
Nothing I write can say
The sadness I feel-
The sadness I feel
Is grey as the grey sky
Cold as the dark light
Deep as the Thoughts
I fear to write.
Nothing I write
Can say the sadness I am-
Even an old man
Does not want to die,
And does not want the suffering
That comes with it.
