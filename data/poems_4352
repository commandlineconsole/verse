FEAR
I live in fear,
of being me,
showing who I really am,
and who I'm meant to be.
Fear is painful,
for me to take,
it's like telling me that,
I'll never amount to anything.
I can't believe that,
I'm so afraid,
of what's left for me,
in this world.
I know it seems crazy,
that I won't show,
my heart to all,
I wish you knew.
I live in fear,
of loving you,
of it being true,
and of telling you.
It's the biggest fear,
that I have,
and it's about time,
I told you it.
I fear that one day,
I stop loving you,
and that same day,
you begin to love me.
It's honestly,
the biggest fear I have,
I'll love you always,
but I'll always have this fear.
