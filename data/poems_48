UNWILLINGLY CRUSHED
Your Approach...
Mine eyes behold
The view you're gracing
Your beauty unfold
My heart starts racing
Your Encroah...
The tension grows
While towards pacing
Your radiance flows
It's fear I'm bracing
My Abroach...
The entrancement
Has my mind failing
Your smile's enhancement
Sends my heart sailing
My Reproach...
I'm Insecure
My secret endure
Eyes opened?
