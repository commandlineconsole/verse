LOVE MATH
Are we doomed, to live this life?
One where questions must be asked?
Understanding is forsaken?
Is it worth it? Are you worth it?
Is ‘us’ worth this?
Is there an us to be worth anything?
These feelings, oh these feelings,
They come and go, some bad, most good.
Understanding is taken out of the equation.
Multiply good by some bad and all I get?
Confusion. Not what I expected.
Not what I was thinking.
But surprise, surprise, nothing is what I thought.
