HAVE YOU EVER LOVED?
Have you ever loved,
Love and say it,
What it is love,
How the feelings of,
The emotions and passions of it
Which only the panting doves can!
Love is love,
Love is a feeling of heart,
Love a bonding between soul to soul,
Love is emotional attachment,
Infatuation for
And they after a mirage.
If not, love and then say to me,
What is it love,
How is it borne,
Which but only a love tell into the ears
Of a lover,
Love is love,
Have you ever loved, if not, love and then?
