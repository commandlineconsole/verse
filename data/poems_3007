I SING MY SORROWS
Leaving desires at the rear
Drinking cusp full of tears
To set you dance for tomorrows
I sing my sorrows
Love and live until you disappear
Like less lovely people on earth to bear
Cry not if to be or not to be there for me
I sing my sorrows
To make you dance for tomorrows
Don’t wanna let you build
Heaven in dark
Mayhem when dogs bark
Roses all the way to shield
Then why,
Firearms only for you to guard
Don’t wanna let you walk
On sands with untraceable mark
As you sing the songs of tomorrows
I Promise to carry all your sorrows
To set you dance in heaven
Before the end has to borrow
I sing my sorrows
To make you dance for tomorrows
Don’t ask me, don’t think for me
Blessed you be for making dreams believed
Created world at will for the personal bliss
When city slept in death made it be praised still
Dwelt in the shadows
Fought the world from your windows
Fearless in solitude
Triumphant with attitude
Blessed you be
Don’t ask me don’t think of me
To set you glance in heaven
Before the end has to borrow
I sing my sorrows
To make you dance for tomorrows
Why are you there?
You be what you be
Sand, snow or sea storm or flooding river.
Don’t you dare to come very near?
As I love to be and its hard for me to flee
The bleak field of sowed wheat
To wear the down pour
Of gifts in rage, you bring
As you sing the songs of tomorrows
I sing my sorrows
Its earth
Like mother’s womb, o dear
Don’t hurt, else wont bare
The food
For me, not be of liking to you
Still there will be bread
Along with vegetables and milk
For you and me in supper tomorrow
I sing my sorrows
To make you dance for tomorrows
Soft suave sensuous skirts on signage
Speaks of satire on seldom seen orphanage
Fingers holding glass, lips with holding class
Silken touch lost a while
Drunken lust frost fragile
Welcoming you with open arms
Broad smile, vivid in beguile
As you take the step to hold sparrows
I sing my sorrows
To make you dance for tomorrows
Thirsty you, world is water
But not a single dropp for you to pop
With raised arms, standing on your toes
What will you ask?
O barren field
You can’t offer crop to shop
Nor will you get mob to rob
But don’t you cry as world is not yet over
To set you glance in heaven
Before the end has to borrow
I sing my sorrows
To make you dance for tomorrows
