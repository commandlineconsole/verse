KALEIDOSCOPIC
I observe you as you work
Kaleidoscopic parts of you
Examining and charting
Lost islands and causes
Navigating through waves of needy people
Needing you
At the helm of the humanship
Therein
A fragment of you resides in
The nomadic mind of the genius
Indifferent to earthly concerns
Geminied with
The intermittent calmness a still ocean offers
Yet
As the prism in a rainbows promise
Reveals it's true spectrum
When allied with the light in an ebony sky
You have been there my flagship healer
Illuminating my darkest hours
Tenderly orchestrating my tidal moods
Kaleidoscopic parts of you
Soaring my spirit and touching my heart
