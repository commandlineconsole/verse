THE COBRA'S DAY
A Festival full of Fake Celebration
We are  surprised with the Amused Anticipation.
What is More Surprising is the Peculiar Participation
In worshipping just for one day is there Public Pleasure
Never will they worship them any other Day
Shouldn't we refer it as Auspicious Amusement
How come they Show their Holy Sentiment only on one day
What is needed are Majestic Measures
If they Regard Cobra as God
Should n't they Oppose The Snake Charmer's Terrific Torture
