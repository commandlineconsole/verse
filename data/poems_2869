YOUR FEELINGS
The beautiful doll that stares at me,
It looks with such sadness,
Even though it has a bright smile.
But isn't that the way we work today?
We cover up our sadness with bright smiles.
Making people think we're alright, so they won't worry.
But that's killing yourself inside.
Keeping all your feelings chained in.
Will you ever let go?
