JOY!

joy!
fallen multicolored leaves,
turning, crumbling, dissolving...
rainbows of flesh,
returning to the source,
feeding new beginnings!
joy!
breathing, touching,
listening with the heart!
the chance and the gift,
another day, another moment!
joy!
someone to talk to,
someone who cares!
who sees you just like you are,
and still loves you!
joy!
the prayers of bare limbs,
reaching out and upward,
with gratitude for what has been,
and the promise of what comes!
joy!
deep, unfathomable, unchained,
and electric pulsing....
joy!
