THE LAKE
Days are dreams at the lake
Like flowers in bouquet of spring
Pleasures of morningâ€™s awake
Everywhere summer birds sing
All is for the evening to make
Pearls on the streaming string
Yesterdays in the forest tall
Morning to come bright and high
Hearing the summer birds call
Echoes that to the lake tie
As its melodies dances and stroll
With every hello and goodbye
Feelings are inside this deep
Like footsteps around going
Ours in times memories to keep
As the water waves are glowing
When mirrors of morn are showing
Waves of the to and fro tides
Billows to bring in its peace
Yearnings of dreams that rides
Among the birds and high trees
Pleasures that gives and abides
With every songsters new caprice
