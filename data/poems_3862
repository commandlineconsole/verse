THE EARTH
I Wonder What Jesus Made
How I Wonder How People Care About The
Jesus Creation

They Donâ€™t  Care About The Earth
They Care About There Selves
They Cut the Tree with no care about the floods
They Kill The Animals With No Mercy
The Earth Was Crying All Day
Plant A Tree that Saves Us For More Than One Moment
