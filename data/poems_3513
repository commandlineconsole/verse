OFTEN I'LL WALK
Often I'll walk
and just remember...
there was a time;
when tomorrow was
not anything to be
concerned with,
there would always
be tomorrow...
and it would always
be more than today
happened to be.
Love was a swing with
the wind in your face.
A dreamsicle when the
sand was searing the feet.
A snowball when the blue
sky was a mystery behind
winters gray foreboding.
A campfire, a thousand stars,
and a million miles away.
Friendship was being out
of school at the same time
as everyone else.
And yesterday...
yesterday was merely
something that happened
the day before today.
Yes, there was a time when
tomorrow was not anything
at all
to be concerned with.
Often I'll walk
and just remember...
when there is no one around
any more.
