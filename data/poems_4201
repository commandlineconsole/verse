LIVE
Live without fear
Like a man on a boat envisions the seven seas
When he sleeps
Like a flower blossoms beneath
The snowy darkened night
Live without fear
like scars compiled
that keep on gathering company
Live without fear
like the women who brings a child into this world of uncertainty
Live without fear
Like a pen that touches
A blank piece of paper
Live,
Because to do so
Implies there is no hindrance
And fear is hindrance in absolute form
It was fear I left behind
Because every time I kissed you,
I knew one day
You wouldnâ€™t be there to receive it.
