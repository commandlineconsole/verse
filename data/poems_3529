VOID
Dead at birth,
end 'fore beginning.
Is there pain felt at the end of a smile?
Feel my soul wandering place to place,
soulessly upon my worries,
i lay.
I know u feel it too.
I cannot know,
i shall'nt bother.
Tides and cloud,
come and go.
And So shall all.
Tis the easiest questions,
i reply to, but raises the most concern.
What is it you ponder?
I beg thee,
grant me audience.
Not of evil but of concern.
Stand naked before thee.
brace me.
Embrace me,
and I in return.
