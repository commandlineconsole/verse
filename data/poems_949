# THE MOTHER
every day
every single day
you carry on your way

no disgust shown
not tired or worn
not a dropp of sweat from your brow
kisses the ground
with that pleasant smiley round

every day
every single day
you carry on your way

not a duty or compulsion you show
you touch every bit of this earth
that you have given birth...with joy
you touch every life on this earth
that it has given birth..with pride and joy
the granny and mummy you are
that pleasant smiley round...THE SUN

with that joy in your face
every day
every single day
you carry on your way
