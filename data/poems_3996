MUCH TOO LONG!
I dont care what they say, with those rumours
I know its been much to long...
Its been much to long since Ive seen you
I wish I love would of lasted
I dont care what they say, your so long gone..
No one can take away the memories in our hearts
Yes we were much to young....... I dont care what they say..
Sometimes hearts belong...
I dream about you everyday, wondering what went wrong?
I dont care what they say, with those rumours
I know its been much to long...
I thought my heart would drift away and a new love would belong..
I dont care what they say, your so long gone..
No one can take away the memories in our hearts
Yes we were much to young....... I dont care what they say..
Sometimes hearts belong...
