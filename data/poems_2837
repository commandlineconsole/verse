MEMORIES
Lie down next to me
sing me an old-old song
my heart is full of sadness.
Looking though boxes of my past
I stumbled across this one
full of clean-clean loneliness,
hopes and desires.
The other one was full of love and happiness,
all the sweet things and dreams.
I wished my life ended at this.
Now Iâ€™m looking for the third box
to put all my sorrows in,
all the sadness, all your photos
and all things
that remind me of you.
