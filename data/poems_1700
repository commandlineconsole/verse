MY CAPER
Who am I to write these words? ,
My thoughts and feelings kept inwards...
Although people read what I write on paper,
I smile inwardly; in a way it´s my caper...
I write these things for sanity´s sake,
And anyone may read for their pleasure to take...
If it touches you, then read it in pleasure,
For I beleive it´s a gift, and I will give it without measure...
