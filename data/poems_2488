SILENCE EMPOWERED
its the power of being mute
not open not quite
is the trick to upset others
punish with pain of indifference.
its the power of silence
exercised by those powerful
to quieten the disquiet
to wrap beneath, away from sight
the well- known secrets of the public life
the reason for the latest fight
the cause of tears, private happiness
that secret smile, a silent chuckle
all it takes to silence anger is to
smoothly iron out differences
of years of baseless arguments
to hug and kiss and repeat it again
silence empowers you
when you chose to ignore
patterns that provoke anger
snides that signal hatred
empower silence thus
be at peace always
