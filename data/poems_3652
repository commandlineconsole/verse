AS A WORLD
I dedicate this poem to Arsiema Berhane in response to her poem, ''War''
Children,
are the joyous praise
of our wealth.
Woman, we
are only just
beginning to
understand
the recognition
of progress
over our bodies
to achieve
rapid growth
of improvement
in the idea of
harmony, tolerance
and virtue
that puts out
an idea
with good intentions,
rewarding
global concerns
as an ideal.
Valuing human life,
encourages faith
as a basis for
recognition of this
relationship that
values people
as individuals,
not merely existing.
