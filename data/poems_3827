I DONT CARE
I don't care,
For the wind blowing, or  the sun shining
or the moon lighting or for stars twinkling, i don't.
Care, if the skies turn green or red or white or even
clouds turning gray or black, i swear to you i don't,
Care, for the rain falling or snow instead or for sandstorms or whatever,
whatever, believe me i don't, i wont,
Care. Not a little,
Not for night becoming day or day becoming night or
neither becoming neither, i swear to you, i don't,
Care, whether earth switches places with mars or mars switches
places with Satan, or if they collide, i don't care, i wont.
But i Care, For you loving me.
