PLANS
Salt in an open wound when we said goodbye again
The pain of our separation all so real once more
Oh why must we endure this?
Week after week I am fading away
This suffering will make me better I’m sure
But will it be worth it when I’ve withered to ash?
Another year or two until we can be together again
The future so far away, teasing me with dreams
I thought you were in my bed the other night
But when I awoke, I was alone...
My plans seem to fall through the cracks
Your plans have no concern for my heart
Our plans haven’t changed yet
Plans, Plans, Plans
Plans shoved down our throats
I am concerned, for today’s world
Not the world of next year
I am sick of these plans
They have no care for my sanity
