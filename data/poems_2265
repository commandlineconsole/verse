THE TRIUMPHENT ANGER
The anger I have felt
Is the most destructive
And painful thing
I have ever felt.
I have tried
Over and over again
To fight off the terrible feeling
And everytime I've failed.
Because of this anger
I have lost many friends
And almost all of my family's
And friends trust.
This anger that I fight
Each and everyday
Has cost me so much
That it has become almost unbearable.
So in the end
My anger inside
Has become the most
Painfully triumphent thing
In my life.
