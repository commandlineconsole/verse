A POEM
A poem
Not concerning them
Yet they feel part
As an inseparable art
A poem to express hidden sentiment
Life's movement with no comments
Surrendering to the helplessness side
Nothing to complain about or to decide
Nice contentment with soul
No complaint about rise and fall
To function in normal parameter
Not to say word as trend setter
It has magical side of untold misery
Keep it to self and cry out on adversary
Giving vent to all that has affected
On melodious form without being reacted
Poetical thoughts with expression
Builds dramatic relation
A bond totally non existent
But very much apparent
Life flows in poem style
Sadness, happiness and in joyous mood meanwhile
Some may express it poetic way
Others may enjoy its contents and have the sway
Either you cry out or retain
But pain is after all pain
It may reflect on face and come out through vocal cord
It is not to be kept within but in a style to put forward
