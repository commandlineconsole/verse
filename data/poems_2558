=[
sadness
i cant feel anything
pain
have bruises all over me, crying myself to sleep
wonder
if u still care about me
sadness
i cant love you anymore
pain i wish i was not alive
wonder
when you will hold me again
sadness
i miss your touch on my body
pain
my heart hurts and i  cant see anything
wonder
when i will stop wishing i was dead
sadness
the moments we had replay in my head over and over again
pain
why did u leave?
wonder
if you really loved me
sadness
i cant stop crying
pain
part of me is dying
wonder
WHEN WILL THIS END?
