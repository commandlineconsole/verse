ANGER!
early morning anger,
raw, jagged edges,
cant-feed-my-family,
cant-pay-the-rent....
anger!
pounding my fists
against a stone wall,
anger!
working, scuffing, trying
to just get by...
anger!
just like so many others,
all of us, struggling
just to keep going...
anger!
standing up, marching,
sitting down, making a statement,
anger!
turning this anger
into positive action...
the key!
