I DIDN'T START THE FIRE..
Fire is like anger,
Anger is fire in my soul!
It grabs me with a word or a deed like the tiny spark
that creates a flame.
Anger like fire can consume me
if I don't control it.
Allowing it to smoulder with unspoken anger
erupting into fierce,
consuming flames
that could leave just a shell
and being behind!
