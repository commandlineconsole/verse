REM BATTLE GROUND
A gleam of light
sinks
in effort
to get back
to the source...
at the
other end
a brain and
lungs engulf
this in-between
inside state
where deep
concerns are
at the other side
in rapport
with thoughts
actively detecting
visible cracks
shooting up
like red roses and
mustard gas
masking a
bouquet of
serious emotions
with a captivating
fragrant stink
looking fresh
in matchless dignity
as I stumble
with stingy eyes
they bow
in humble Osaka
fashion
and I am strangely
comforted by this
decoy.
