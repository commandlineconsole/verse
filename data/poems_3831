SHOULD I CARE
Why should I care about you?
When you don't care about me..
Should I care if I hurt you?
When you hurt me when you get a chance..
Should I care if you break up with me?
When I think we aren't meant to be..
Why should I try to make you feel good?
When you don't care about how I feel..
Should I care when people talk about you?
When all you do is kick me when I'm down..
Why should I care what you say?
When you ignore me whenever my mouth opens..
Why should I care to think I stand out?
When you seem to care about others more than me..
Why should I care to have friends?
When never there when needed..
Should I care to trust you anymore?
After what you've done to me..
Why should I care to be in your life?
When you're ruining mine..
