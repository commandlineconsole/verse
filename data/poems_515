THE GATES
Knowing that you are my first love
But not my only passion
Have thanks for giving
In a single moment the refreshment
Of a journey’s end, at Mecca or
Jerusalem, the cool water that
Staunches a man’s desire.
Knowing that you are my last passion,
My only love, I have praise
For your eyes and lips and for
The parts of you that move sensually
In my imagination, like the
Girls of Lahore on sweet July evenings
With the smell of jasmine in their hair
And breath tinted with ripe mango.
Knowing that love and passion
Flow together, I have songs
That flow from Allah who took
Dry earth from the desert
and purest water
From the springs near Jericho
And shaped you as a wish,  أمنيا
A living soul seeking paradise
Through the gates of love and passion.
