I LOVE YOU.....
I love you; I love you so much,
I love you for true;
I love you in my thoughts,
I love you in my dreams;
I love you;
I love you when I am awake,
I love you when the dawn breaks;
I love you;
I love you when the dusk falls,
I love you every moment;
I love you;
I love you even when I am asleep
As my love for you is so deep;
I love you;
I love you as I am born for you,
I love you as you too are;
I love you;
I love you, I love you so much,
I love you for true;
I love youâ€¦
- to my love
