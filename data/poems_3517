HOSPITAL CURES? ? ?
Hospitals are to cure you of your diseases.
The aches, the pains and such kinds
They are to relieve you of concerns
about you, your family kith and kin ||
Hospitals are here to cure you from money
the time, happiness, joy and care
they relieve you of humanity concerns
about the doctor, nurses and the attendants||
The hospitals provide food
and cure your appetite for good
The food is little and very bland
or it is still little and very spicy||
The rooms are but railway bogies small,
narrow and without privacy
The convenience is little and small
but is sure to cost you a fortune||
You earn in your healthy days
and save for the rainy day
Your saving is completely empty
if you go to the hospital even for a day||
Many tests are done after many pricks
keeping you in the hospital for days to weeks
Diagnose they don't for many days
you'll go back home without any improvement||
