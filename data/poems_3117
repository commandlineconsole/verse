(())    AS IF....
I touch your hand and
...am made happy.
As if my sorrow
has had a makeover.
As if my sorrow
won the lotto.
As if my sorrow
had a sexchange
and become the happiness
it always knew it was.
As if my sorrow
found religion
and converted itself
into happiness.
The joy of you
flows through me
and I light up like a light bulb.
As if...
As if...
