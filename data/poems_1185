ABIKU
Coming and going many times
Delight me not or my kindred
Missions incomplete, frustrations, send me
Yet I have to convey it
The ties on my waist and neck
The very reason for which I go
Albeit to regain strength to afflict
As your love means me no a thing
Let me stay and play
Allow me to be with you
Look away from me
And I riches will unleash
I hurt not except duty bade me
Hates, not on my way
When you cast no strings on me
And when I am hot, merry
The marks and the cuts
The libations and the gifts
Delight me not or my kindred
I am destined, and destiny waste not
