UNDETERMINED FEAR
I'm the best ever was,
You won't stand a chance.
I also have a fear,
But it is Undetermined Fear.
If you're big & strong,
I will not run,
Like anyone does,
My fear is Undetermined.
I may be brave,
Braver than anyone
You can do it also,
Having Undetermined fear.
If you're stronger than me,
It is because you're many,
But I'll prove it, that...
Undetermined Fear is the best.
