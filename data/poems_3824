MY LOVE, LIFE, LIE
My brain drips out an ear.
I care no more.
My life fell down a drain.
I care no more.
My thoughts are the cd-players.
I care no more.
My personality, the radios.
I care no more.
My love falls away.
I wish i could care.
My hate, the lyrics.
I care no more.
My naivety is my own.
But every one else's is the same.
I'll be dead tomorrow.
I care no more.
as I'm dead today.
