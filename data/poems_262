LOVE IS IMPERISHABLE
Love is undefinable
Love is Un-manifest
Love is Omnipresent
Love is incomprehensible
Love is unchanging
Love is immobile
Love is constant
Love means restraining all senses
Love means being even minded everywhere
Love means engrossed in the welfare of all beings
Love love love and love and know yourself, know love.
