REGRETS
It's raining
Children are out playing
Not gonna worry about death
Only concerned of living
Seeing and breathing
I close my eyes
I see darkness
I see depression
I see death
One day your alone
Thinking there's no one home
You take your first dose of meth
To cause your death
Your laying on the ground
Your in denial
Your thinking to yourself
Is this the last of my trial
You can't change what you've done
The drug has already won
Now your thinking of regrets
And your life is done
How could that be fun
Next time your stressed
Just go for a run
