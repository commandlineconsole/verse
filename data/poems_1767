INVITE ME,
Invite me,
Invite me to your place,
There is something I can never hide,
That you are the making,
There is no stopping me,
There is no hesitation within me,
Invite me with a lovely pleasure,
That you are so numerous,
That you took me to an awaiting pleasure,
Invite me to a feeling,
That is pure and true,
No stigma or disguise,
I got that feeling,
When you give me eternity,
When you tell me that the Kingdom is my awakening.
