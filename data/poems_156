TO BE LOVED
To Be Loved

To be loved as a friend
to be loved as a brother
to be loved as no other.
To be loved as one
to be loved for fun
to be loved on the run.
To be loved for no reason
to be loved turned to treason
to be loved for all season.
To be loved like a pair of shoes
to be loved to be abbused
to be loved to be used
To be loved like one insane
to be loved and take the pain
to be love till it becomes a drain.
To be loved like one at rest
to be loved like the very best
to be loved but yet be upset.
To be loved in every way
to be loved more every day
to be loved no matter what they say.
To be loved but yet unknown
to be loved yet shown
to be loved yet out of tone.
To be loved inside
to be loved yet cry
to be loved yet die.
