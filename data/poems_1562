PLEASURES OF LIFE
Life is a simple pleasure,
surrounded with flowers blooming and birds singing.
Poems are the greatest leisure,
filled by expressive emotions and beautiful wordings.
Reading is a fantastic enjoyment,
learning endless knowledge from people's writing.
Listening to music is another heavenly gift,
soothing the eardrums with beautiful lyrics and angels' harping.
Freestyle is a maximal relaxation,
that release one's soul.
Singing is an emotional expression,
fill the air with sweet melody and sentimental sensing.
The pleasure of life not only upbringing personal joy but also universal enjoyment to us.
How can people live life through without pleasures?
Whether the Earth is rotating or making it's revolution around the sun, it does not stop us.
Why not we continue to enjoy the pleasures of life to the fullest?
