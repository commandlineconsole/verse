MR. FACEBOOK
Mr. Facebook,
Why do you want to see my face in your book?
For there are advantages and disadvantages on the net;
But he who is married is concern more on how to please his wife.
A tiller of the ground and a keeper of sheep,
I have got a dream on your muse;
For she who is married is concern more on how to satify her husband,
But you've been able to capture the world with your 'Facebok'.
Many can now cantact others but,
There lie the disadavantages as well;
Because it can easily expose one's identity!
And we all know what is going on, on the net of late.
