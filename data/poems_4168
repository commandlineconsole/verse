FOR IN AGES PAST AS KNIGHTS DID TOLL
for in ages past as knights did toll
onward came the night
the darkness of fear
alone they stood
alone against the dark
the fear
alone against there greatest fear
and at their darkest hour
did one stride forth
one of might and valor
alone amongst his kin
alone against the dark cold fear
against his might did the dark attack
with fang and claw
with wing and beak
yet still he stood
alone in the dark
against there greatest fear
even as his back did break
his shield rent and sword asunder
did hope come to him
a simple smile
a simple voice
of hope
for even in this great dark
this greatest depth of his fear
he knew
alone
he was not
