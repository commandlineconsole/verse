IF YOU CARED
If you cared to look,
You wouldn't miss me,
You would see me there,
at the  intersection, staring as you pass.
If you cared to read,
You would'nt miss my cardboard sign.
I hold it all day,
so you can see me.
If you cared to ask,
You would know my name,
My age and my likes,
You would know, I once was like you.
If you cared to smell,
You would smell the filth I call home,
You would smell my sorrow, my pain and my hurt.
If you cared to share,
I wouldn't go hungry,
a meal for the day  and a bed to call mine.
If you cared to touch,
You would feel bruises of neglect,
Would feel the wrinkles that line my skin,
My unkempt hair and over grown nails.
If you cared to feel,
You would feel the  hurt and pain in my feet.
If you cared to listen,
You would'nt miss me,
You would hear my cry  and see me there,
Calling out to you.
