THIS SHOULD COME TO NO SURPRISE
It should come to no one's surprise,
That anyone who has lived a life...
Being scrutinized and unjustly depicted,
By a mocking done to do...
As if the one subjected is not aware of it,
With a living ammuned from others doing this.
Especially in environments expectations are kept low.
It should come to no one's surprise,
That anyone who has lived their life to exist...
Is happier to know that a few one chooses,
And associates with to have this experienced...
Are also amongst the ones keeping their distance.
And this should come to no surprise,
To those who live to lie, gossip and deceive.
