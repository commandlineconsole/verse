IN THE CRADLE OF THE DARK.
Meet me
tonight i will make a surprise
the poem that you have read which i carelessly wrote
does not smell like the incense of a monk
i guess you are carried away by its flamboyance
the man has a pipe and releasing a big tobacco smoke in the window
meet me tonight
it will be a big surprise
what you read does not look like myself
it is something and i am someone else
hopefully i will be a surprise
and God forgive
i just hope that you will like it
i could be light wrapped in the cradle of the
dark.
