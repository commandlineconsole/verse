A MEAL AT NIGHT
As the sun sets to bring the night
The wise old owl hoots in delight
Spreading his wings in a tired stretch
He searches for a breakfast that'll be quick to fetch
Spotting a mouse that would be such a meal
Swiftly he flies to the life to steal
Thus the wise owl feeds at night
And lets out another hoot of delight
