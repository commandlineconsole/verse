THE FUTURE IS CLOUDED
The Future is clouded
What does it hold?
The future is shrouded
But the future is my mold
But is the future really my mold?
I have realized though, in this life
That everything I do has repercussions 10 fold
And that life must have some Strife
I do not wish to have complete control
There needs to be some surprise
If it didnâ€™t life would have a whole
Life without surprise, all else dies
But maybe that is why everything dies
So we all will appreciate life
So we appreciate the surprise
Of being alive
So we realize life is worth living and that life is rife
With what is needed to survive
