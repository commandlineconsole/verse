SONNET: SORROWS PURIFY OUR SOUL
When sorrows visit in quick succession,
And there’s no time to reason out or cry:
When mind and soul are in eclipsed session,
From the very beginning, then tears dry.
How much of sorrows can a heart withstand?
How much of stress and strain can humans take?
The anguish seems to even flood the land,
When earthly living seems almost a fake.
But, God made man to bear any despair,
And sorrows crown our life but not for long;
Most often life appears very unfair;
But listen Man, for joyful is His song.
Yet, sorrows purify my soul, O God!
It makes me fit for Heaven’s Abode, Lord.
