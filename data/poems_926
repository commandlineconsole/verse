SOME JOYOUS MOMENTS
Moments of joy never stay
Forever in any ones way
For it is like a cooling breeze
That blows for a while then cease
So whatever chance you ever get
Try in it for you to set
A nice trend to follow smile
And take it with you for miles
And learn to wipe the waves of pain
And swap it with the current of fain
And try to adopt the art of joy
So you can learn to enjoy
And make moments of joy to stay
For a little longer in your way.
