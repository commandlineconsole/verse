LOVE IS TRUE
Love knows no age,
nor looks,
nor height,
Love only knows what's inside,
Love lets you know you are free,
love understands how you feel,
love never leaves you,
love never haunts you,
If you understand what love is,
then you understand the meaning in life,
love can show you the truth,
love can show you the light,
love is the only way for you to live your life right,
Love never judges,
love never hates,
though love sometimes suffers,
though love sometimes fades,
love never truly leaves us,
because true love is fate.
