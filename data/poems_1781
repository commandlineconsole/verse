A STORY IN HAIKU
I cannot escape
Deep inside my ravaged soul
Restless demon wait
Something to help me
Take it once, twice, then a third
Fog of sheer pleasure
Pleasure turns to hurt
What have i done to myself?
Darkness swallows me
Escape from the black
Someone gently helps me up
I'm alone no more
Fight is not over
Mindless addiction kills me
Will it never end?
Pain, most simply, pain
Then the brutal agony
Softened by your hand
Sunshine breaks the haze
First thing I see is your face
Suddenly, I love
As the years go by
And we slowly drift apart
I never forget
