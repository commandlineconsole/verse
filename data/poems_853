HER LAUGH DIVINE
Ah, her laughter known to many
Though they know not what it is
to hear it by the innocent suitor
Happiness never known before
Till she laughs in her tone
the tone of her laugh divine
It's the tone of the lovers happy in life
it's the tone of the angel who passed from mankind
It's the tone of nature in the fall and the spring
It's the tone of perfection known only to those
who's heard her laugh divine
If only but a light chuckle
if only a quiet laugh
if only heard but a moment
joy for life obtained
the joyous feeling of her laugh divine
It's the joy of those engaged to be wed
it's the joy of a life once saved
it's the joy of the parents of a newborn babe
it's the joy of the men knowing the light
it's the joy of her laugh divine
So this is the feeling
nearly an obsession
this is the feeling of love
the love known to those
those only who's heard
Who's heard her laugh divine.
