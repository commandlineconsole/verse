DO ME A FAVOR
Wish fate would end my pain and sorrowfulness
Save my soul from the darkness
Life have mercy on me
It’s too much for me
Let me rest
I am so exhausted
Can’t you see my tears?
My bloody red tears
Can anybody hear my soul cry?
Can anybody see the darkness?
Its inside
In my heart, growing
Time to fly
Hate. Terror. Life
Hurt. Die. Kill.
No regrets
No looking back
I don’t want to even be remembered
Just forget all about me
The sooner the better
No grief
No problem
Don’t even want a funeral
No more holding on
No more holding back
I just gotta let go
Once and for all
Give my audience what they’ve all been asking for years
Just burn me to ashes and dump me somewhere
Like the trash that I am
Someday you’ll know that what I did tonight was all for the best
Leaving you for the last time
Softly whispering as I go
Tonight my mom’s and dad’s marriage will be saved
Cause tonight
This tragic event will bring you back to where you should be in
In love deeper then ever before
Thanks to this promise I make tonight to keep
I am not scared
Cause if you kill me in the end
I will finally be away from you
So kill me in the end
So I can be free from you
So I can be gone from you
So I can finally live a good life
Kill me in the end
Tonight I think I’ll do everybody a huge favor
Tonight for sure…
Kill me
Kill me now
Kill me quickly
Just please do it
I have no worth
All do is cause of pain
And stress
I am only a problem
Never able to find the solution
I live in pain everyday
Please if you care
So please
Kill me
Kill me now
Kill me quickly
Please I am bagging you
I am so lost and confused
I will never be found again
So please save me from all my future suffering
What do you want me to do?
I can’t give anymore
Nothing
Nothing at all would work
I’m sorry
I just can’t take it
Someone please kill me
I need to die
I can’t do it my self
I’ve tried
Death is not an answer it’s an escape
Only tears there as I press the blade against my skin
Tears are mixed with my blood
Now I’m satisfied I deserved that pain
Please kill me here take this knife and murder me!
