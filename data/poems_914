BRING HAPPINESS
Spen less time in worrying about tomorrow
For life is a journey of joy and sorrow
So bring happiness along life's way
And learn this rule for yourself each day
And try to find its road through life
And learn more rules of joy to survive
For happiness is like a flowing stream
That emitts joy's light like a beam
And give happiness to all who deserve
And know to bring other's happiness love.
