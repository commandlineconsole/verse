LOVE LOVE LOVE
Love is bonding between sisters and brothers
Love is sharing by husbands and wives
Love is caring of parents & children
Love is emotional with everyone else.
Love is potion on the bed
Love is ocean and never dead
Love is in our hearts and in brain
Love is in blood and in our veins.
Love happens, can't be created
Love is compassion, can't be rated
Love is smile, makes us laugh
Love is deluge, can't be hated.
Love is not showing your assets
Love is different from bloody lust
Love is not possessiveness shown
Love is what you give the best.
Love is not in your eyes
Love is not on your lips
Love is never demanding
Love which is true, never dips.
Love makes you to sacrifice
Love makes you to survive
Love can't be gauged by language
Love makes a dead to revive.
Love knows no frontiers
Love knows no religion
Love has no caste
Love has no region.
Love is passion, love is respect
Love is forgiveness, love is peace
Love is power, love is faith
Love is prayer, love if true never cease.
Love makes you feel wanted
Love makes you get mated
Love makes you feel seduced
Love never makes you subdued.
Love is everlasting relationship
not infatuation
Love is everything
but punctuation.
Love is not give and take
Love is what you do for other's sake
Love makes you feel stronger
Love is God makes you live longer.
Love is inferno, experience its pangs
Love is jealous within the gangs
Love is life, smooth but coy
Love is rain, indulge and enjoy.
Love is grace, blessing our progeny
Love is exhilarating, ending our agony
Love makes us positive, negating the negatives
Love is symphony bringing the harmony.
The concept of love can never be defined
It is so vast and too refined
Love is eternal and never dies
Love makes human sane and wise.
