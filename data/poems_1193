POET AND PLAYWRIGHT
People may perish
Yet words usually nourish
As mourning turns to mourn
While the vigorous sun smile and scorn
Honest is spoiled by a tempting lady
As infant, too when he misses daddy
A playwright is all the time right
When the poet conquers shining night
Till words are the reason of amazing delight
A delight of both poet and playwright
But recall the verse is the master of all art
Art or words put up a wonderful and superb art
Poet's words amaze and intrigue each part
Eve is the master of earth and nature
Of Adam's and his fertile pasture
Words are not words when they praise
Nor when they mock or amaze!
