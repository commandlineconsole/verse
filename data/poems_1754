WE LIVE IN A HAPPY WORLD... YET..
Almighty made a world
For us to live in happiness,
Small and large in size,
Yet we hunt for trouble,
Fighting mad on principles,
Selfishness, ethos, myths,
Belief we do not grant
for one and all, ending up
In trouble, sadnness, madness
Anger of our own making
Having no control
Over our own mind,
Not expanding to contain,
The problems coming by,
Making  a mess, forgetting
The pleasures of togethrtness
Love, forgiveness,
Offer us in plenty to live
In happiness that is
Denied by our own selves,
Forgetting that the earth
Is the paradise made by god
For adam eve and children
Who we are really
To live in pleasure forever.
