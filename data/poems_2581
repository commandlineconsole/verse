SADNESS
Sadness Sadness
Dark side of the world~
Why you brought sadness to my soul
So dark as the night
So sad and impolite
Who are you to make me feel bad
You took away all i had
The gate of my heart
closed and hot
Sadness hot that burn and inflate
bad words, bad names, just need a little of faith...
