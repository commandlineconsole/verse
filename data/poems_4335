(THERE IS NOTHING REALLY EVER TO FEAR)
Fear is regression
regression is pain
pain turns sweet sunshine into bitter rain
take my hand my dear
for there is nothing to fear
Fear is anguish
anguish is sorrow
sorrow is but a deep hole so hollow
let this not be the end of me
hold me tight and set me free
oh embrace me so close, so near
for there is nothing really ever to fear
Fear is destruction
destruction is chaos
chaos is a cynical and unruly boss
that can become your surpressive master
do not let fear take control
of the every corner of your innocent soul
Take my hand oh my dear
hold me so very near
for there is nothing that we should ever fear!
