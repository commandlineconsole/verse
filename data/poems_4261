ESCAPING FEAR
Escaping Fear
(Idea and input by Anita Atina)
Does fear hold us back
Does it make us lose track
From dreams unfulfilled
From dreams we must rebuild
Love allowed to drift away
Emotional debts left to repay
Passions allowed to wither
Like a snake they slither
What restrains us
What makes us jump on a runaway bus
Fear itself is a necessity
It balances common sense and calamity
It teeters between our heart and brain
Accomplishing things that I can’t explain
Fear is that final taste
That if we don’t try it is all for waste
Failure has its successes
To learn from what it professes
So from fear there is no escaping
Be adamantly in charge of what it’s reshaping
