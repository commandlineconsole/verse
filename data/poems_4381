FEAR
Often I wondered what is fear,
Is it here, or there, or anywhere,
Or is it within self-induced lair
Of uncertainties in fantasy’s fair!
Is it receding confidence on war,
Signaling mind to bare and bear!
Casts like shadow, pervades like night,
Fear blots warmth and shine from heart;
Fear is the chill that freezes inner might –
No reasons it bears, nor wrong or right,
Stills it heart, spurs sprite to fight,
Renders trust hollow in pathetic plight.
Why comes fear, and how it works,
Why in its face all confidence shirks,
And fear adds to fear for fatal shocks –
None ever figured those fluid tricks;
Fear is rebound of forward push,
Nature’s tight leash on onward rush.
Life is light, and fear, bleak shade,
Twilight that signals darkness ahead;
Life is Moon, and fear, South Node
That restrains and bids to halt and hold,
To think either ways before you proceed –
Fear, true guards who protect and guard.
Life is onward thrust, fear is its leash
That leads on track lest life would crash;
Enforces prudence ‘gainst haste and rush –
Indeed a hurdle is fear to wistful push,
A break that saves untoward huge loss
And forces in life rare patience and grace.
