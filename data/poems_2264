FEAR
Fear in my mind
Of the anger in side
Try to hold back
before I attack
I can’t escape
When my anger awakes
I try to run
but it pulls me along
scared, afraid
can’t get way
the only life I know
consumed by anger
don’t let it out
or pain and anguish
will rein about
I can’t control it
Only one way out
Slit my wrist
Pull the trigger
Barry me six feet under
To decay and wither
I’ll take my pain and anger
w/t me to the grave
then piece will come
to my family and friends
then they’ll live happily
till there ends
