INTO ITS VELVET CLAW
The natural body’s rhythm
elevates our passions to peak
far about the temples of the gods
when the blood rushes through our veins
in our search for love.
We, ourselves the epitome of perfection
when love calls out our name.
We submit to its passion
over and over again.
We stand at the wall of China
and feel no foreboding there.
Love gives us understanding,
yet makes us gullible
to the invitation of the all.
Our presence infuses
desire and passion into one,
to anoint us with oil
of love’s warming rays
giving our heated bodies
the energy to stay
within the moments of passion
whenever they come to call
and look onward into its velvet claw.
From dusk until dawn breaks
enrapturing our bodies by its call.
We are consumed by its pleasures
as we fall under its spell time and again,
as day fades for another night to begin.
