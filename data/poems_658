EMOTIONS
where the passion lies
what the soul desires
when the heart wants something
it requires.
desires are best forbidden
emotions running high
intense situations
light up the sky.
lives interwined
always connected
destined to be
together always.
passion and desires
make life worth living
to have these things
is a blessing
taken for granted
but cant live without them
these emotions u have
are ignited
