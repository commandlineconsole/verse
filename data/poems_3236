WHEN THE SUNLIGHT COMES
All my days are full of rain
Never sun
Only rain
All my days are full of pain
Never fun
Only pain
Since you left me my sorrow is strong
Never weak
Always strong
I want to tell you I'm always wrong
Never right
Always wrong
When the sunlight comes my days are beautiful
Never ugly
Always beautiful
When you come my days are wonderful
Never dull
Always wonderful
If you come back the last rain will arrive
and wash all the pain and sorrows away
