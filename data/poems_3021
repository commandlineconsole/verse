DISAPPEAR
All I've ever wanted to know
Has been moved outta place
I want to leave, want to go
But instead, I'll disappear without a trace
He held me together
When I was tearing at the seams
Now I'm shut away forever
Drowning in sorrow when I scream
I'm falling in blood and tears
I've known you for so long
And after all these years
You decide to say 'so-long'
He held me together
When I was tearing at the seams
Now I'm shut away forever
Drowning in sorrow when I scream
Don't pick me up
Just let me fall
You used me as back-up
But you never cared at all
He held me together
When I was tearing at the seams
Now I'm shut away forever
Drowning in sorrow when I scream
Let me just disappear
I swear I'll leave you alone
I just can't be here
I know my feeling was wrong
He held me together
When I was tearing at the seams
Now I'm shut away forever
Drowning in sorrow when I scream
Just stay the hell away
Don't even say my name
The pain will gather day-by-day
I'm tired of this game
Don't hold me together
Even if I rip at the seams
I'll stay shut forever
Drowning in sorrow, not bothering to scream.
