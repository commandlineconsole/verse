JOYFUL SADNESS
Something so simple, such as a smell
Can bring about happiness, but at the same time hell
Something so simple such as a song
Can make you smile, whilst feeling everything is wrong
Things so simple have memories locked in
Memories of love, sadness and sin
You wish to forget, make them go away
But you know forever they shall stay
Joyful sadness is this feelings name
So easy to feel, yet impossible to explain
