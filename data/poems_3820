YOU DON'T CARE
I had closed my eyes to the truth and lived the lies
Can you tell me that you sorry?
Can you look deep in to my eyes and say it?
We've been friends for 10 years and you don't even care
You told me you loved me
You knew i felt the same
But you don't even care
You promised me we'd friends forever
But you don't even care
Our friendship is fading
And you don't even care
You don't fight to keep our friendship
But of course, you don't care
The rest of what we had is slowly dying
But i keep forgetting you don't care
You were a true friend, we were never apart
I protected you, i fell for you and yet you don't even care
What kind of a friend would make another friend cry
Some say that friendship could never ever fade
But now I feel I have no friend cause I have been betrayed
