SADNESS RULES OVER ME
Sadness, is everywhere.
You see this child acting all happy,
When their eyes scream that they're sad.
Nobody nootices, notices how much pain they're in.
But I know, know more than they think.
Come with me my friends, we'll help eachother along.
Every god and universe could be against us,
But I know we'll make it through,
You will be happy with adventure in your lives.
Sadness rules over me, even when i smile or laugh.
Nothing and no one can help this sad soul of mine,
Even when i smile, even when i laugh.
All i ever feel is sadness ruling over me.
Chorus->
A forever raining sky,
No sun, no light to guide me through the cold night.
Love is just a fairytale, a tale that happens in dreams and stories.
Happiness is just a cover, an excuse,
For all who don't want anyone to be near their
Heart,
Soul,
Mind,
and sometimes Body.
Sadness is everywhere,
In mind, heart, body and soul.
->Some are too broken to heal.
I'm past broken, and into a sadness filled black hole.
Never to resurface nor truly live again.
This is a song where it rules over me.
Yea, it does, Under everyone's noses.
All but mine.
Sadness.
Rules.
OVER.......
Me. .....................
