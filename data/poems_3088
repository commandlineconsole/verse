SORROW'S TWIN
I am sorrow's twin,
No smiles here.
I have forgotten the sound
Of my own laughter...
I ramble around in dark rooms,
Stand in corners of dispair.
Can't get out of here.
My twin, sorrow,
Lay heavy on my chest,
So heavly I cannot rest.
Go away, you foolish whims
Speaking in whispers of a
Better tomorrow...
Leave me here with my twin
Sorrow!
She knows me better than you;
Makes no promises to be
Broken,
Gives out no token
Lies of peace and truth.
Let us be!
My twin sorrow, and me!
