UNPLEASURED IN A DAY
Pleasure for pleasure and
Pain for pain some say they are
Incohabitable me thinks
The opposite is the plain
Playing in turn and furthuring
The rain and longing the days
Longing for peace and logging
The pain pleasure may lay in
Pleasuring ways me thinks
These may be a symptom
Of the end of days
