PLAY FIGHTING
Two tiger cubs fought tooth and nail
Regardless of the cost,
Each chewing on the other's tail
Such that both tigers lost!
With claws extended to the max,
Ferocious growls to boot,
Then climbing on each other's back
While striving to look cute!
Their little ears were throbbing pain
From scratches and from bites,
The cubs retreated, rushed again,
Determined in their fights...
The other cubs looked on with glee,
Far off and out of range,
As if they'd lost the novelty,
While these two wouldn't change!
Two tiger cubs now nose to nose,
Up close and personal,
Content that they fought blows for blows,
Until one had to fall...
Yet these two cubs would find respect
Within each other's eyes,
Though others thought them incorrect!
Surprise, surprise, surprise!
