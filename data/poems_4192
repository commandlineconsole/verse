DARKNESS
Darkness is what i fear the most,
i dont know why i fear it,
i feel un-comfortable and worst,
my heart beats so fast,
and my hands shiver with fear,
i know its a foolish fear'
but i dont know why i fear it,
i feel as if there is some body behind me,
but i am sure that there is no body with me,
i dont know why i am so foolish,
but i will win my one and only fear one day..
