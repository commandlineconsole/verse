Love love love love
Love is the light of all lights
Where there is truth there is love
Where there is love there is light
Light is truth, truth is light
And it is beyond darkness beyond ignorance

And is within all
Truth truth truth truth

Life is in love
Life is in truth

Life is light
Life is truth
Life is love
Love life my dear
Say once and for ever
I love you, you are my love
You are my light
You are my truth.
