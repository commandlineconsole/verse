JOY
What is Joy? Is it a emotion? Some may never know. Others might not care. But I shall always know, and shall always care. For I have met true Joy. Joy is love and comfort. It is being with the one you truely love, no matter their color or gender. No matter who they are. Only your being with them in love, in soul, as one...Truely Matters. That is what Joy is in its purest form.
Pure And True, Love. True, Holy Joy.
