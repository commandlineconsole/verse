SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE
To arrange for a surprise,
I gain a problem in the order of conducting it,
In that effortful step to tax himself who is myself.
I surprise my bride and my now wife,
For she is too good at living with me.
I have the taxation policy from offices
And my rigour in keeping is vast.
Much is to be attained by my school of affairs,
Inside it is a new branch of scientific diploma.
I can see the woman of my love who is my wife,
As much as the times of my whole life,
Such that the honeymoon never got forgotten
And the ceremony became an anniversary.
Young women do find a science
And that is Me, and my wife is these young women.
