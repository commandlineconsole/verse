O YOU
O You
that you are who you are
when you are
when i need
bring me to fruition
delight in the one i am
i have become
as i always find delight in you
you, being you
send me sojourning
back to myself
answers, you need not give
for they lie within my soul
searching makes me stronger
thrill to my strength
bask in my verse
you, who you are
