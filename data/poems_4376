CURSES
Don't ever look at me,
Avert your eyes, stare away,
My darkness no longer a poignant call,
But something to fear.
I fear me.
Don't look into my eyes, ever,
You'll see a billowing hurricane,
A lifeless call, a bony eclipse,
Turn away.
Their darkness allures no more,
It's something to fear.
I fear myself.
Don't ever look at my hands.
They shake as I stare at them,
White as sheen, an iceberg,
Drowning me.
Trembling with my fear of self.
I fear me.
Don't step closer, a single word,
Could blow me further away.
I stand, a wisp of smoke,
Still afraid, still unsure,
Of myself.
Stay away. I don't need you,
I already
Fear me.
Though I don't know who I am,
And that makes me afraid.
