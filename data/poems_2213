ANGER FROM DEEP WITHIN
Angers fury takes a mighty toll
throughout my life as well as deep within my soul
Anger and pain no one deserves to receive
once angers fury strikes, is hard for it to leave
Anger reacts from the devils most desired sin
He strikes you down forever, from deep, deep within
Anger is a fury that is begun by sound
its loud, its agonising when its all the time around
Anger is rotting my life and always in my head
to understand me, you must know all of the things I dread
my anger is usually what's responsible for what I do
it takes over, and I let it,
in my life its the only thing that's true
Anger is that voice in your head that's shows you your fear
its like a mini tiny Satan on your shoulder
and whispers in your ear
Anger is always here, he stays and lingers on
Anger may cause a hole in your heart,
and makes it hard for you to move on
Cant deny, the fact that anger does not run in you.
He is in me, from my pain,
I know hes in you to
Anger is not good, because anger can make you do,
Horrific things that are filled with regret,
and cause more anger too
Anger can make you cry,
Anger can Make you want to die
He is in me, and he is in you
He can make you do
What he wants you to
Anger can make you go insane
in the brain
It tears you from the inside,
itâ€™s like an inner acidic rain.
Walk to the shining light that is seen through that door,
But wherever there is happiness, anger will linger forever more..
