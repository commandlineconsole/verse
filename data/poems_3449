ARTIFICAL AND REAL
The tears of crocodile, can't be seen,
But told in epic and legend as a clean,
Image with polluted metaphoric illusion,
In the tropical rain forest capitals, people planted,
Fabulously decorated trees of palms and flowers,
Out of fossil fuel, mad made jungle with flyovers,
God made man to the current man of intelligence,
God made brain to the chips of mother board's reign,
Compelling smile of the concerned individuals,
Concerned calls from the human of convenience,
Flowers are beautiful, but they are painted and shaded,
To bring out the non existing glow of the women,
Exhibition of acquired wealth and status,
Comfort out of swiped cards and credit,
All really not look real, but artificial.
The tear of needy human is real, not artificial,
The cry to be employed is real, not artificial,
The weeping in the closed rooms is real, not artificial,
The hope and expectation in the hearts are real, not artificial.
