MISERY, THE SHADOW OF THE LIGHT
Sorrow, fear and disease you cannot avoid.
To lose your mother or child is sorrow.
To face the people or the future is fear.
To decay to pests and accident is disease.
Sorrow: Learn to live with.
Fear: Learn to cope with.
Disease: Learn to bear with.
The end is certain, anyhow.
