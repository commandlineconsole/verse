SHIVERING AND SHAKING
Shivering, shaking
Pleasure and desire
Shivering, shaking
Cold but on fire
Shiver and shake
Make my body ache
Fill me up with need
Then satisfy my greed
Moan and groan
In agony
In ecstasy
Prove to me
You'll set me free
Shivering, shaking
Pleasure and desire
Shivering, shaking
Cold but on fire
