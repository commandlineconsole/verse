YOUR PRI IS COMING BACK
Sleepless nights,
Still having so many dreams in my eyes.
Watching moon that keeps an eye on the world,
surrounded by stars in its own world.
Waiting for moon to dim it's light,
Sun awakes and birds chirp with day delight.
Each day will pass in wait of another day
When i'll move back on that bay,
That follows till my home
Surrounded by fields and corns.
Where my mom dad welcomes me with delight,
What to say it's pretty long night.
Moon started fading it's brightness,
Birds wakeup, Sun started sprinkle it's shiness.
Few days more
Then i will move back to my lovely place,
where mom dad awaits for my presence
and will cut my lonely days.
I am delighted with this cheerful thought,
I waited for this moment, waited for that alot.
Now i'll move back to my beautiful home
Mom dad Your Pri is Coming back to home.
