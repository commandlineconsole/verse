YOUR CHARACTER
You must first and foremost be concerned about your own character in every situation.
There is no escape from this very spiritual law, ever so supreme.
If you judge a person, no matter who they are, for their character
Then you are no better than the 'evil' actions you have seen.
There is but one person who should concern you the most,
And it is not someone who lives outside of your own body.
No matter what you say and no matter what you do,
Ultimately your character is what forever shines through.
