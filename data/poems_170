LOVE
I love the way you hold me
I love the way you care
I love the way you look at me
and how you're always there
I love the way you kiss me
and how you hold me tight
I love the way you make me laugh
when we talk all night
I love the way i don't have to act
I love that there's nothing to hide
I love the way you grab my hand
and pull me to your side
I love the way you wrap me up
I love the way you touch me
I love the way my heart floats now
because you've set it free
I love the way that i feel loved
I love that i don't cry
I love the way my doubt's erased
and you don't have to try
I love the way i trust you
I love the way you grin
I love the way i feel now
so safe, it makes me spin
I love the way you say 'i love you'
I love the way smile
I love how you make me laugh
more than just once in awhile
I love the way you make me happy
I love the way we're true
I love the way you love me
but mostly that i love you.
