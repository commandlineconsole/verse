I WISH I KNEW...
I wish I knew what passion felt like,
To wake up and feel the passion to be happy and to love.
Passion is the eagerness to wake up with the light.
And passion is what fights the  dark every night.
I don’t think I have ever known true passion,
But that wont stop me from seeking it like an impossible mission.
To search for the one that will show me that,
True passion is what life’s really about.
