LIFE AND JOY!
Red, pink, blue and violet! !
With these colours representing your muse in the land of joy;
But, life is full of laws for mankind.
Love!
Commendable;
Puts, inputs!
With life and joy.
Life and joy!
Like the tortoise and the eagle;
But, walk always with the truth and live in peace! !
And, try to meet up your goals with the laid down laws.
Life and joy!
Slow but sure with the muse of the tortoise;
Life and joy!
Flying up high like the muse of the eagle;
But, be very wise always with the muse of love.
