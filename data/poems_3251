CRYSTAL DARKNESS
The dark lounge of life
whispers in my crystal glass
calling my every sense
its you I await
in hollow corridors
I sweat tears unto you
sorrow surrenders me
helpless...
Black clouds crest my being
seeing the devils desire
falling deeper and deeper
into the rainbow ripples
of crystal chalice.
Sway the walk of life
in timeless bottles of sorrow
drained the happiness
of love...
I decend into depression
