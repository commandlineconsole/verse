LIFE
life is a mystery
can't be eternal
life goes on by a sad and happiness
and it's end up with nothing but memories
life is too short
like walking in the sea shore
seeking a right place
and live in a peace

life is a greatfull thing
it gives you time to feel something
that's worth a big surprise
big surprise of true happy living
