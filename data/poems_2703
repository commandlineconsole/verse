I'M A FRIEND
When sadness fills your heart throughout the day
And everything don't seem to be okay
Teardrops will roll down your cheeks
Telling me words that you can't speak
Sometimes you tried your best to hide
The sadness that's deep inside
But you don't realize that you're also hiding your smile
That I've been seeing all this while
Maybe it's something never meant to be shared
Even with friends who really cared
But that's not something I'm forcing you to do
You know yourself better so it's up to you
Sometimes we try to get into each other's shoes
But can never fit for us to go through
But if we can laugh together then we sure can cry together
I don't come and go, I'll stay forever
Sometimes I wish I can take the sadness out
Even without knowing what it's about
But I'm just a man, I'm just like you
I'll never know a thing without a clue
I just took this time out for you
Although what I'm saying may not be true
But if I'm a disturbance, I'm really sorry
But having my best friend in sadness is something I can't afford to see
