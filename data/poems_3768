YOU AND ME
When you laugh, i laugh
When you smile, i smile
When your happy, im happy
When your sad, im sad
You cry, i cry
I feel the pain you feel
I feel all your goods and bads
Why? , because i care
I care because you care
I love because you love
Im here, because your here
to take care of me and others
others you know and don't know
But non the less you still care.
