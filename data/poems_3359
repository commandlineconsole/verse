HEALTH IN DANGER
The danger of health is such a lie,
In this side of my heart I cry and delve
Into higher modes of learning,
The worship of this I adore more than others
Who are people of deep concern.
The range of deserters in this world
Concern our judges as men of distrust,
Men of whole disgust, men of germs
And what is their health right now?
They are buried under the stars forcibly.
