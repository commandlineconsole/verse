AS THE BUNNY
I feel myself beside you
to be the bunny without
the scut

I am covering
the place
where could be grow

I am covering the confusion
with my smile
I know what you expected
surprises are my strong
point still
more than once
I will surprise you
with frolicsome pranks
and the delicacy of caress

with unusual project
of the bedroom
on the tree
you will get to
like everything
what is bringing
variety and anxieties
of the body
under my accidental touch
I it I know,
for the present, my dear,
cast a glance  bunnies
from the 'playboy'.
