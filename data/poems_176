OH, MY LOVE!
Would you wait me, love?
Oh love, would you look for me?
Love, could you cry for me?
Would you love me, love?
Oh love, could you love me?
Love, my love, how wrong could love be?
Do you feel, love, my love?
Could you deny me love?
Would you stop loving me?
Oh love, how can i love you?
How much hurt love can bare?
Would you bare if i hurt your love, my love?
How sick love has to be, to be hurt and still love?
Oh love! Why love?
Why do i love you, my love?
Who should i love, love?
You or me?
