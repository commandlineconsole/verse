SELF IS GRAND MOTHER OF ALL!
Knowledge is mother of fear,
minion of mother,
Understands what is fear,
Knowledge of pain,
Knowledge of failure,
knowledge of action and reaction
and when grown up,
becomes minion of fears!
Soul in the growing body,
knowledge becomes mother of fear,
May be pain of a fall,
Or a bite of ants or wasps,
knowledge of things around us is mother of fear!
Knowledge of own capabilities and inabilities,
Knowledge of bondage and faults,
Old age and death,
knowledge of pain
strain,
failure or insult,
knowledge of fall is mother of all fears!
Body, mind and intelligence,
When glows with knowledge of world,
Every thought and action,
Orbits around unknown fear,
Spinning or rotating around axis of fear,
its cute pet name is carefullness!
Paradoxically,
Fear is mother of all Knowledge,
Fear of fall,
Makes one carefull on walk,
Fear of  consequences,
Makes one to think right,
act right or walk straight,
Fear is mother of all Knowledge,
Takes one above the plane,
or takes one to man of knowledge,
Make one polite and flexible,
fear of death makes one to think of eternal,
Fear of law, may be law of land,
Law of divine or law of nature is mother of knowledge,
Everyone is comes with lesson,
Either to teach or to learn,
Every fear of consequences is mother of all Knowledge divine!
Fear of flaws of own,
or flaws in human laws is mother of all Knowledge!
The best teacher never preach,
But teach to clean the knowledge that is mother of fear,
Tears off the veil of fears,
Lit the lamp of knowledge of fearlessness,
light the dark corners,
Fear of sin or reasons for the fall,
Replaced by knowledge of courage,
Expert is that captain of ship,
Drive to safe still water,
Anchore safe,
the ship swinging in storm of fear
Is safely anchored in knowledge free of fears!
Or fills with knowledge of fearless Self,
can pierce the balloon of fear,
Make one
Work well, live well and behave well!
And fear becomes a trait,
Knowledge is mother of fear,
Knowledge of old age,
Weakness of old age,
Or may be of body and mind at growing stage!
Experience of adverse
gives rise to knowledge that is mother of fears!
But experience of love and compassion,
Fear of fall is good companion,
Teaches discipline and restraint
Make one daring and caring,
Someday one will understand the paradox,
'Knowledge is mother of fears,
Fear is mother of all knowledge,
God is father, and Self is Grand mother of all! ! !
