DON'T FEAR THE REAPER
Don't fear the reaper,
He is not what he seems.
He walks into your Nightmares,
He walks into your dreams.
His Black scythe cuts into your mind,
His Black cape swirling beyond his eyes
So don't fear death and he will slow,
Don't fear the song you Despise.
Don't lose your mind and fall apart,
Don't fear the reaper, let him touch your heart.
