CURIOSITY
Tread on
Paths untread
Pleasures!  un found you will find
No path
You will have to find
Recall
When in life you looked back
The pleasure and inspiration you could find
Only when,
The darkness in you and around abounds
Look back,
On the untread path you have tread
Pleasure you will find
Which  in  inspiration  abounds.
