PLEASURE
I desire pleasure and joy
since I'm Adam's boy
I always look for them
regardless how they came
But I don't crave intoxicants
they are not be sent
coz they don't really uplift me
but they pretend
I want real pleasure
not the regret
If really you want to
render me pleasure
that be proved real
and remain for forever
teach me the music of life
so I could listen to it
at every  stride
and sing it with
eternal pleasure and pride.
