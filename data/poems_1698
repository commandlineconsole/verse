YOU SAID RIGHT
two souls  together, in  every moment of every age
love was their companion since first sight as first case
their souls meandered in heaven, danced pleasure created
erhaps were thrown to earth, when God was cheated
they  loved each other, earth as heaven originated
after  life they came in different land but in love form
love is born here  again, two souls  united and dissolved
These memories are still fainter but not even fully forgotten
In every age you said right love is immortal and eternal
truth, I worshipped love, blessed with pleasure perpetual
