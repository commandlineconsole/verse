WHY DO WE LOVE LOVE
Why do we love love
why does love even exist
we all get hurt by love
so why love love
we all have our faults in love
love comes and goes like the wind
you have to be careful who you fall in love with
cause if you dont you will end up hurt
why does love even exist
to me love is just like a can of worms
you will never know what you are opening up to find
love is a challege which i like to take
be careful who you love
cause one day you might wake up and their gone forever
live life to the fullest
dont let love hold you back
