MILES WITH PINS & NEEDLES
Journey with a bucket of pins & needles
Journey with a bucket of feelings that meddles
Creeks that mislead of unsoundly pebbles
Sounds of sorrows that is unable to juggle
Strains incident to deprive rights left hollow
Being diffident is as been symbolise as shallow
Leaving the gains taking the pains that’s been swallow
Closing the iron gates to escape our very own shadow
Pins & needles willingly clench, full of hazards of sorrow & pains
Putting all the dreads back to it drains; Cowers oneself under the crust of the ocean
Gladly summon the arsenal of depression; cowers one’s sorrow to cover the shame
Twisted painted minds pictures it pins & needles
Shattered dreams of fake scam with illusions
Solemnise sorrow shall never be follow
Gust of wind enlighten the pains & needles
Bleeding on the shadow accepting gladly traverse of rapture
Experience taken as a fairy tale adventure
