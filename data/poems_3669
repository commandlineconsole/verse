TAKE CELEBRITY OUT
I don’t care about your girlfriends
I don’t care about your affairs
I don’t care how many your wives
I don’t care you divorce with who
What I need is your entertainment
I don’t care about your castles and cars
I don’t care about your new styles
I don’t care if you famous everywhere
I don’t care you know many connection
What I need is your talent
I don’t care about your plastic surgery
I don’t care about your disturbing behavior
I don’t care you run from your rehabilitation
I don’t care you have a fight with who
What I need is your hard work
I don’t care about your orientation
I don’t care about your life philosophy
I don’t care you are a selfish and arrogant person
I don’t care you could move thousand people
What I need is your result
