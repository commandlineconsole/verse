KIDDIES PARTY
The kiddie’s party’s underway
The titchy ones have come to play
Criteria for getting in
You must be three and love a din
Jammy cakes for all such do’s
Are worn in hair and some on shoes
Into mouths, a little goes
But takes a detour up the nose
Cakes with little sweeties on
Turn your back the sweeties gone
And all the little kids deny
Surprise surprise, it’s their first lie
Pass the parcel round it goes
You pass it till the music slows
But some hold on and won’t be beat
Surprise surprise it’s called deceit
Blind mans buff they feel around
Go and hide don’t make a sound
The blind man sensing his defeat
Takes blind fold off, he’s called a cheat
Now it’s time to sit and eat
The stuff that isn’t on their feet
It’s all the choccy cakes they pick
They laugh at different coloured sick
A goody bag; it’s time to go
And kids their gratitude will show
Mummy says “say thanks Jerome”!
Jerome with bag, has f****d off home
