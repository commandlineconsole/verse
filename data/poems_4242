MY GREATEST FEAR
In life everyone gets scared
Spiders freak me out
Creatures in the dark terrify me
But that doesn't compare to my greatest fear
I'm scared to death of heights
Of plumetting to my fate below
I don't like being in water, the fear of something pulling me under
But that's nothing compared to my greatest fear
I could die a thousand deaths
Be tortured and in pain
Even being raped
But that isn't even close to my greatest fear
When my illusion's gone
And all that's left is me
When no one can stand to love me
I have faced my greatest fear
