SOMETHING FINALLY BELIEVED
Why are those now so concerned,
About a budget?
When then they expressed no limits seen.
While feeding their greed that became obscene?
Why are they concerned,
About jobs they consciously outsourced...
To leave those here incapable of earning.
And they wish to convince,
Everything done they do makes sense?
To who?
Their tailors paid to keep them in expensive suits?
Well...
Maybe if they defined themselves as 'mindless',
It would be something done admitted.
And something finally believed,
Many would agree has validity and substance.
