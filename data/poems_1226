MOONLIGHT (COMMENT OR RATE PLEASE)
Moonlight
You’re so bright
Bringing me down your sweet delight.
I just want to take flight
Like a bird in the sky
Im watching you from here up high.
Making me fell like a dragonfly
I spread my wings
To see what life brings
So many pleasures
So many treasures.
Take delight in all that’s right
Bring forth a smile tonight.
