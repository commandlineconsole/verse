MARY KELLEHER
Many miles from her old home in Aubane in Clondrohid she lay
She did not live on for to grow old and gray
The great gift of life from Mary kelleher has gone
But her genes in her children are destined to live on
Her hair was as dark as the wing of a crow
The lovely Mary I knew of from decades ago
Her mother Nell is still living the late Con Kelleher's wife
There are no guarantees in the length of one's life
Survived by her husband and her children and her siblings Denis and Tess
I do feel for her family in their sorrowfulness
I knew her as young and lovely and free of conceit
When she lived in Aubane near the Town of Millstreet
From life's cares for us all there's a final release
And at Clondrohid may she rest forever in peace.
