AT THE JUNCTION....
When you are trying to give me sorrow
i don't mind
at the junction i take another direction
away from you
there is no way that sorrow goes with me
there is a wish
may that sorrow you sow follow you
wherever you may go
they are all yours
each sorrow bears your name
and they must
as i pray
follow you wherever you go
they are yours
and shall be yours forever
on my part, at the junction, where our paths depart
i have chosen
a thousand joys.
