PLEASURES OF THE SPIRIT
It's a fallacy to the closest mark of intelligible misconduct of infusion
It's the most prolific and intriguing despair to nature's richest spirits.
Pleasures of the human is different from that of the spirit
Pleasures of the world pleases the flesh not the spirit
For the spirit find refuge and
Pleasure in their own illusive moments,
When the only sight and power
Given to them by the Supreme of all spirits.
Their senses are blurring without the Holy Spirit in them.
Their thoughts are infused into thick dark smokes
When the Holy Spirit is not with them.
For the Holy Spirit is their comfort and pleasure.
Praises to the Holy Spirit is their utmost beauty
And endless desire and appealing to their spirits
All their pleasures comes within the Holy Spirit
And its in the Holy Spirit they find shelter
And their deepest pleasure is in their thoughts
