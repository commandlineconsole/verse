COLD WEARY DAY
Why did you go away that cold weray day
Why did you make the decision not to stay
leave me behind to pay
How could you go and never say goodbye
Now what I am left with is pain and anger inside
Why didn't you talk to me
I was always there and free
I don't understand why not me
your best friend
How do I face today, without you by my side
My anger towards you has built so high
But today and tomorrow I refuse to cry
I know you aren't satisfied with the turmoil you left behind
I love you, why didn't you care
I miss you, why didn't you stay
Why did you take you life that cold weary day
