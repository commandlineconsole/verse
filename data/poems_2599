HAPPINESS AND SADNESS
Happiness what is it, is it love,
or is it just another sound, another word,
happiness is just another thing,
happiness is just another thing to believe in,
Happiness is only for those who deserve,
those who do not won't get the happiness,
those who are happy I pity them,
they know nothing, nothing about this world,
Happiness is evil, we may not see this,
but its true, happiness is evil in so many ways,
happiness is a disguise for the true world,
the hard, cold, hard loving world we live in today,
Happiness is the only feeling you think you want,
I know it isn't I know the dark secrets of the emotion,
I know its hidden secrets, I know its every lying lies,
happiness so cold and unfair to those who don't have it,
my only emotion I take for granted is sadness,
I find this emotion deep, profound, yet enlightening,
sadness so cold and envious is so true,
the sadness is what we need on this world,
sadness is the true world happiness isn't,
the decision is your, live a dream or live reality,
i'm living reality and i'm in the sadness,
the cold, dark, alone, cruel, all alone sadness....
