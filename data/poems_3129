LIFETIME NEWS
Cried yesterday; Laugh today
Don’t know how long going to laugh
Morning is Dark; also evening’s dark too
Man’s also being same in child and old.
If don’t take food, it’s a disease; also over-eating a disease
Can see always happiness and sorrow
Oh God, the creator of everything
Ye are only one who resists sorrow and happiness.
Due to so much happiness, never asked for sorrow
Let me endure all the sorrow for Thee
Give me energy to abide the tolerance
Also, provide me thy pleasing good news
