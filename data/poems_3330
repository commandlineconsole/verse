WHAT LOVE SHOULD BE
Who cares if love is blind?
As far as I am concerned, I can see
And I can see through your emotions
To know if truly you are in love
Who cares if you have fallen in love?
As far as I am concerned, I am standing
And I stand strong to pick you up
After you allow a love blind to fall you down
Something I know about love:
Love should be a beautiful thing
Something that makes you stand on your feet
Something that makes you see your heart
Love should come with butterflies
Love should make you feel strong
