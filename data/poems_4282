FEAR
Fear is only in your mind
Open the door see what's behind
Take that first step, the next will follow
You may love your tomorrow
Set fear aside, it's not your friend
Instead to your heart a chance you must lend
A chance to move on, a chance to love again
A chance to make all necessary Â amends
Don't be afraid to follow your heart
Don't be afraid of a new start
Fear will rob you of happiness
Fear will rob you of your bliss
Take that first step to a brighter day
Don't let fear take your chance away
Trust what your heart is telling you
Live life to the fullest in all you do
