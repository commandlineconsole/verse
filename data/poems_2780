CYCLE
Sadness roams free
Death decaying
Madness alike
Dieing again
Love is no more
Lust brakes free
Hatred soon follows
Envy strikes all
Sadness follows envy
Death causes sorrow
Madness is a state of mental death
Dieing causes one to go mad
Love it to let your heart die
Lust is love
Hatred follows broken lust
Envy follows hate
In this cycle we all sit
Waiting for the next
Death to come
And take
