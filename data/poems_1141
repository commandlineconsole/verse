PATHETIC ROMANTIC
You are a pathetic romantic
Running to paradise to find
A jar full of delight
Trying to escape the phantom pain
Under this earthly rain
You want to be in some tavern of eternity
You are a pathetic romantic searching for
Paradise
Wanting to be in some tavern of
Eternity
To escape the phantom pain under this earthly rain
You are a pathetic romantic running to
Paradise
Trying to find a jar full of delight.
