SAD FRIENDS
its sad you were not there
people like you just dont care
i some times just  think
do i care or may i dare
friends stand by their friends
just cant think, why you tripped
you should  have been there
still me thinkin you cared
how sad, of me to belive
that the sad friends
was not real friends
so now i ve moved on
and got rid of them friends
and got great friends
who cares,
