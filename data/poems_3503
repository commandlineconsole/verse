RETHINKIN SOBRIETY
One of these days it might be good
One of these days it's bound to feel the same
Although every time my heart starts to rush
It's me by the phone and the waiting game
All I can think is I need a smoke
Shots of tequila and a 40 of beer
Every event in my life for today
Adds up to surprise that I quit for a year
Cuz at least when you're wasted there's just one concern
How do I get to stay feeling this way
And maybe one asks 'Just how did I get here? '
But when all's well and sober, it's hard to complain
Getting fucked up means fucking shit up
And lawns go unmowed… bills go unpaid…
But recovery? Addiction? They're like the same thing.
Aimless people living day by day
If indulging a little doesn't solve any problems
Then the opposite axiom must also be true
When one is well and sober again
Nothing is fixed- troubles have ballooned
At least when you're wasted there's just one concern
So here is my question I have for you
Would it really be such a tragedy
A reunion with a substance I used to abuse?
