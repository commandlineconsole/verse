LAKE OF PAIN
Tomorrow is another day,
Yesterday already went,
Here comes another day,
And just like they say,
It’s just another day,
But today is the day,
When I felt my soul lose its way,
When I felt sorrow mix and sway,
My sorrow and sadness,
My loss and hurt,
They all began to turn into a lake,
A lake of sorrow, pain, and gray,
Don’t look into my eyes,
Don’t turn your heads,
Because if you do,
You’ll be lost in a void of pain
