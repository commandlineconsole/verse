***COME ON SURPRISE ME
you surprised me
i'm now burried in my own desire of you
now i want you to take me and see tonight
if you could taste me better save a moment
in every line of your dream and every string
of your guitar, oh i love the way
you draw and take my breath away
you breathe so deep here in my ears
you create a real desire here in my heart
but i want you take your time
and act like you made me
as the wife of your soul
oh, come on surprise me.
