I LOVE THAT I LOVE YOU
I love that you are here with me
I love that we are still friends
I love when we talk you always smile
I love that you’re alive
I love that I make you happy
I love that I can’t forget you
I love that it’s everything I wanted
I love that you’re here
I love when you smile
I love that I always smile with you
I love that we get along wherever we are
I love that I love you
I love when we laugh together
I love when I hug you
I love that our friends know,
I love you
I love that I only want you
I love that fate brought us together
I love the way you talk to me
I love that you are here in my life
I love how you choose me than them
I love your words
I love that you’re clean
I love that you make me feel special
I love that you’re mine
I love our friends
I love how you’re peaceful
I love your parents
I love how well they’ve raised you
I love seeing you smile
I love that you mean so much
I love that I love you
I love how I would kill to be with you
I love that you’re in my heart forever
I love that you are my first love but
I hate that I love you too much
I hate that I don't hate you
Lilly James
I hate that you left me
I have that I fell for you
I hate that your smile haunts
I hate that you died
I hate that I can't be angry
I hate that I'm upset
I hate that you wanted this
I hate that I wasn't enough
I hate that I couldn't make you happy
I hate that your gone
I hate that I don't hate you
I hate that your laugh is gone
I hate your gentle kisses
I hate your friends for not crying
I hate that I can't stop crying
I hate that life goes on
I hate that your not actually dead
I hate your choices
I hate the drugs that you love
I hate I feel that your dead
I hate you're no longer mine
I hate the people you now call friends
I hate the men you sleep with
I hate your dad for what he's done
I hate seeing you so unhappy
I hate so many things but the one
I hate the most
I hate that I love you
I hate I would die for you
I hate I'll never get over you
I hate this new you
I hate myself for not hating you
