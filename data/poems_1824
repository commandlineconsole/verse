SURPRISE AND EXPECTATION
Blurring the relationship between
surprise and expectation,
we sacrifice elation
and compromise by ritual and routine,
for nothing can surprise us always and
our expectations must be met
by reason and without regret
without surprise, once we can understand.
András Schiff is playing all 32 Beethoven piano sonatas in chronological order at the Walt Disney Music Center. In an interview with Martin Meyer he declares: “Beethoven manipulates the blurred relationship between expectation and surprise very cannily, and already the music proceeds in a way that would be in accordance with its preceding “plot”.
