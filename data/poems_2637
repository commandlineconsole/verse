SADNESS
normally after a death
a loss, a fight
sadness is a feeling
which follows you
all through life
a memory
come back to play
in a mirror
for but one to see
a haunting
of one
who has lost hope
cries silently
and fights insanity
sadness
it follows you
like a shadow
it comes to you
in a dream
sadness.
