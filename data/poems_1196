A SKY SO BLUE
A sky so blue
no stars in sight
clouds disperse
in silver moon light
dreams come true
thoughts ignite
total relaxation
to my delight
Cloudless horizon
a night so bright
untroubled thoughts
poems to recite
look very closely
at the water sprite
hovering gaily
awaiting invite
The night has come
flames shine bright
heat from the fire
warms me up at night
no care in the world
to blot or incite
a wonderful feeling
fills me with delight
