A CALL TO LOVE
My blood spills for passion
And my skin longs for your touch
In this love never taken.
O, when will love long for me
For here I am waiting in vein yet, still
My blood flows for passion.
I feel so wretched and frail
Like a scare crow on the rice fields
In this love never taken.
How hopeless it may seem for me
Going through endeavors in this diversion of love, but still
My blood flows for passion.
When will the clock tick its hand for the heart of mine to love.
For I am tired of staying
In this love never taken.
I have seen no more days and lonely nights
Yet now I see the sun shining on
My blood flowing for passion
In this love never taken.
