'FOR THERE CAN BE SURPRISE'  BY DAVID HART

'For There Can Be Surprise'  by David Hart
'For There Can be Surprise' by David Hart *
For there is more than a blank dark
screen
The white dot doth to and fro venture
Is there more than a continuous hum?
The ploppityclip of the white broad band
Doth blithely dance
Is that the sound of a gnat's wing batting
Amidst the droning hum?
Waiting, waiting, waiting
When will something come?
When will something happen?
Living life-waiting, wishing, waiting
For there can be surprise
Shocking, joyous or otherwise
Can we speed it up, let's make
Something happen! !
The white line-does it snap
No need to care, monotonous buzz-
A joke?
Startled I am! For there can be surprise.
*(This poem is best to be read in front of a television tuned into a channel without a program so the static noise can readily be heard)
