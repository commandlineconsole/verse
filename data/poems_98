LOVE
Love is life
Love is lovely
Love is coping with its strife
Love is humming lullabies’
Love is smiling thru goodbyes
Love is touching one another
Love is inborn in a mother
Love is nothing in vain
Love is everything to gain
Love is a potion mixed with butterflies
Love is flying in the skies
Love is singing in the rain
Love is saying I love you again
Love is for your peers
Love is special for your dears
Love is almighty when you’ve loved everyone else, but
Love sure don’t forget to love yourself
