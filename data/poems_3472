WHEN WILL WE EVER LEARN
There is so much out there of concern
When will we ever learn?
How many times must man turn his head?
Pretends he does not understand?
War destruction everywhere touches everyone
From sea to sea, seems no one in control.
Not in my backyard matters not whose on the
Throne, as prayers to be said, as we bring our
Sons and daughters back to our native land,
to be buried in our soil near home.
When will we ever learn? The whole world is of
Our concern, as Americans we stand up tall,
How many ears  must man have to hear the people
