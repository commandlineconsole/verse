LOVE LOVE
I love love, it's so lovely
I love loving love, being loved
Loving others loving
Feeling the love, I love the feeling
The feeling love brings
It makes my heart sing.
My heart sings of singing
My soul dreams of dreaming
And I, in love with love
In the midst of it all
As I fall into love
Love of love.
