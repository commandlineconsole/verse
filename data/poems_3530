FROM WOMB TO GRAVE
Arctic terns
Born in the ice-cradle
Never see an abode
In the Arctic
Arctic terns
Travel only to find
The summers and day
Not the winter chill and darkness
Arctic terns
A bird destined to travel
And to seek the apple orchards
To nest, breed and leave
To fly to the flowering summer
Of the west, the banks of Volga's
To meet the cranes of Siberia
And to flock and flee
To the unknown
And the unfamiliar
With no concern
Over how to seek
A branch to nest
Nor did Arctic terns
Care to quench the thirst
To fill the belly.
Arctic terns
Live as lord Jesus told
To live with no concern
For the uncertain tomorrow.
Arctic terns
Live only under sun
Not under the moon
And not under thick dark
They travel with no stop
Just not to miss the day light
And wish to live and die
In flowery summer
And the beaming sun
Not so scorching
But smooth and soothing
And they spend the span
On migrating
From continent to continent
Until the curtain
Is lowered and they leave!
