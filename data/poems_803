IN OUR WORLD OF JOY
In our world of joy
We play with fain's toy
And arrange them all
In order of big and small
Where each joy holds
A value bold
I wish if forever
I can smile ever
And bring peace of mind
That's one of its kind
That can tell me why
We should have hopes high
And why it's a must
To keep happiness first
I want to again bring
Happiness and joy's spring
In my world of joy
Where everyone enjoys
And hope like this
God's love and bliss
Will always fall on my life
Where I'm bound to survive.
