JOY
The mind is not the medium for joy
Each joy is the bell within the heart
Ringing like a wave-tossed power
Restless but content as polished art

Joy is the cry of sculpted stone
Harmonies that hollow out the mountains
Rich in longing and full of desire
Tearing chunks of glory from the sea
Melting steel with love for life and me

When meaning has meaning, joy roars
Salient and strong, the resonance of drums
So I would and could to you convey
All the words of joy that I can say
