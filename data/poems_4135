DESIRE AND FEAR
Desire reins fear
And fear, desire.
As desire succeeds,
Fear subsides and vise versa.
As desire to swim gets through,
Fear to swim fades away.
Fear of repercussion kills
Desire of being immoral.
When desire is impulsive
Fear takes back seat.
Desire can conquer fear
But not its consequences.
