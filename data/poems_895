JOY LOVE
Skinny tough road
In the middle of the joy love.
That led to the house of joy.
I took it. The engine nearly
Drowned. I lied that it was happy
That I'd do it again. When I got to
That ocean
The house was gone and when
I looked forward, so was the path.
Now I'm older. Drown in my bed
A thousand miles island.
For years I thought
I could
joy my way back. People sing
Of orchid dawns. This country's a
Beautiful joy
Of the one I left, except
I've awful dreams. And
You're the only
Person who's love to joy.
Is it the same?
For you.
