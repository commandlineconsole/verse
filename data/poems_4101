WE'RE MOLES
we are moles
we are moles
fear lives in our souls
we are moles
we are moles
fear lives in our souls
if you take us out of holes
you will kill us poor moles
so much fear
so much fear
we will die when you get nearer
so much fear
so much fear
we will die when you get nearer
if you take us out of holes
you will kill us poor moles
we are moles
we are moles
fear lives in our souls
we are moles
we are moles
fear lives in our souls
if you take us out of holes
you will kill us poor moles
