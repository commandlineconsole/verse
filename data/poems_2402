ANGER 'ON TRIAL'
Very first one, if this is not liked please bare with me.
Anger always gets a bad rap
but to me and my life,
it is part of that map.
Many obstacles, more disappointments I arrived to
Anger was the emotion,
that helped push me through.
Love, Sadness, and Happiness
they all stand strong,
Anger is always the one to blame
but is not always wrong.
Evil, fury, rage are characteristics
and synonyms of this offense,
your honor, I know Anger....
may I take the stand in his defense.
