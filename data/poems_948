SET THINGS RIGHT
Set things in their places right
Look for joy before your sight
And learn to do it all
Before life's day get a fall
For no one else but only you
Can do it in a style new
And show that with courage and hope
You can surely wipe your mope
So do it now and set these things
And bring you the joys of spring
And learn to place things in right
And look for joy before your sight.
