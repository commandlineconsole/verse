FEAR IS
fear is seeing someone get killed
and knowing you are next
it sounds like a scream for help
that keeps getting farther and farther away
fear taste like blood from your teeth
because you are clinching them tightly
fear feels like you will die
because you will
it smells like a dead body
that was left in the sun for a week
fear is as black as night
and as scary
