.3. TIRED EYES
Things I’ve seen through tired eyes
Some look bad its no surprise
From a distance far away
Lots were closer where they stay
Some things seen I can’t repeat
Many shabby not so neat
Often very near our house
Lots in hiding like a mouse
Things I know I’ve seen enough
Lots of frightening ugly stuff
Many things left no surprise
Looking strange through tired eyes
