A POEM OF JOY IN OLD AGE
A POEM OF JOY IN OLD AGE
A Poem of Joy in Old Age
Is a small poem
Of a single quiet perception.
The morning light
The smile of a small  step-grandchild
A happy turn of phrase.
A flickering joy
The mouthful of a morsel
A walk to see trees and sky.
A child no longer young
Leaning over with a hug
Before yet another good-bye.
