DYING.
Its not a coincedence of weakness,
And fear about it,
There's no knowing whether
It'll occur today or tommorow!
No discrimination in age,
There's no knowing how much you sang about it!
How many poems you have
Written and recited about it,
Whether you're a hero or heroine,
Wars fought and battles won!
We depart one after another,
More quickly than the dewdrops
On the roots or tips of the blades of grasses,
Though art slave to fate.
Sometimes I wish I could
Rewind my life,
To think about all my actions
One more time
And think about all the people I hurt,
Emotionally and physicall,
I knew all aches would one day
Come back to haunt me,
But never knew It would be today!
Perhaps if death is kind,
And there can be waiting,
I'd write and recite other poem,
To you some fragrant night,
And tell you how much I love
More than this,
Write a rap song for the rappers at my funeral,
No sad songs to be sang for me,
I'm not gonna feel your sorrowfulness anyway,
You must never think
I'm missing facebook, Twitter, Poemhunter,
SoundCloud, Reverbnation and,
Youtube, and Hipipo dot Com,
Don't shed anytears,
Don't lament or feel sorry for me,
Repent and conffess for all the evil deeds,
I'm quivered of falling into,
A monster's abyss,
And be forgiven by all
I've unencumbered,
I'm dying.
