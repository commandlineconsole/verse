FOREVER GONE.
I never thought I'd meet
A woman so strong,
Someone so loving
A person beautiful inside and out.
With all the love you smother us with,
I never stopped to realize it.
Everything you have done,
is Appreciated from everyone.
You yelled and screamed
Because you cared.
You hugged me when I cried
Because you cared.
You punished us
Because you cared.
And Now I am Crying my eyes out
Because I Care.
I cared and you cared and now you are Forever Gone.
