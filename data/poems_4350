REPTILE: THE COBRA
Many a time I have been encountered by cobra
His Hiss is much familiar to me, a brave reptile.
Why brave? I have the reason to say or those
Who has seen freely moving around, the King!
Shining black or brown in his own ring,
When stood hooded hissing, ’a warning to pose’
Never bite silently but with warning,
’ Leave me alone’
Pleading, ‘live and let me live’, don’t move,
Once at my Door,
When I was at Jodhpur, at the dusk,
King and Queen sat coiled
Greeted with their style
With hood.’ the hooded agile’
Twenty feet away from us,
Bahar, Shaista and Pardaz,
Seen, stood with surprise
We moved after they gone, into the jungle
I haven’t seen so brave and lovely reptile than cobra
I love simply; I love by heart without any fear
Cobra a royal reptile before biting warns, make sound hiss
But men; my friends, in love, they bite to kill with kiss
Before prior intimation
I learnt seeing them and seeing men
Fear is the womb of crime
Fear came from the dark kingdom
Fear blinds eyes and vision
Fear kills freedom
Fear for existence a useless fear
A humanity destroyer, my dear
