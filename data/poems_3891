RECONSIDERATION
Brothers, why shall we despair?
Brothers, why do we never care?
Let's be considerate and fair,
Life is good and love is there,
Don't deny love which moves every part,
We all need one another's heart,
So do it and put the horse before the cart,
We all ask for one common feature,
To care and help our human nature,
Life is not get, take and torture,
Life is trust, care and such a feature,
Let our life be eternal and rare,
Have you heard words of care,
Please never quit nor them tear.
