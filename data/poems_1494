A RICH PLEASURE OF LOVE!
All are for pleasure endless!
Love is bitter sweet in taste;
Love gives painful pleasure;
Objective of love is pleasure;
For love all bear all pains!
All living species are for love;
Sans love where is life here?
Life sans love is useless ever!
Nobody lives sans love anywhere;
Love is greatest power anywhere!
Why is all for love though has all?
The pleasure of love cannot be bought
The pleasure that gives satisfaction
Love only can give against all riches!
