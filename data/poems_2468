ANGER
Anger

The anger in me
wants to come out
saddled in chains
of mannerism and etiquettes
it wants to BREAK

Sometimes it is triumphant
and is set free
either through words
or through silence
but great many times
is suppressed
eroding me entirely

this dormancy within wants
to erupt in shrieks
like lava flowing beneath
but when I pen it down
