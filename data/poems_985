JUST A FEW WORDS
May each morning
That you see
Be filled with joy
Just for thee
So you enjoy
All your day
And see bright sun
Shining in your way
For when you feel
Good in heart
Then it surely gives
A brighter start
For some more joy
Fun and smile
For all who deserve
It for a while
So try to begin
Each of your day
In the shadow of joy
To brighten your way.
