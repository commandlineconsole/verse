THE BIKER'S NEW MISSION
Once he rode motorcycles
Living only for pleasure
Not knowing of heaven
God's greatest treasure
An instrment of Satan
Chosen for his plan
Who would ever believe
God could change this man
But God desires no one
Should end up in hell
So into this life
He sent someone with the Good news to tell
He still rides his motorcycle
Sometimes for pleasure
But he has a new mission
Telling others of God's greatest treasure
For to his fellow bikers
He can speak about the Lord
Showing them the way
From God's Holy Word
And someday he'll join others
Upon Heaven's shore
For the greatest of rallies
That lasts forevermore
