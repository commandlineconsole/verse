DAVID BOWIE
With your blond dyed hairs
And big fat hips
It obviously to me you’ve, , eaten to many chips
This weekend- weekend
I tried to tell you were getting fat
But you said to me, you could have handle that
And not’’ to
Worry- Worry
So I said to you
Now it will never fit
All the fat
As covered the slit
So now I have
Sorrow- sorrow
I hope you’ve lost it
Before the next time we do
Because if you don’t
It will be like sleeping with sue
That will bring
Sorrow- sorrow
I tried to find you cause I can't resist you
I never knew just how much I missed you
Sorrow – sorrow
You never do what you know you ought to
Something tells me you are
George’s daughter
Sorrow – sorrow
(You said you like singing
But you’ll have to do it solo
I wonder if I mean something else? ?
Better be careful, lose lips and all that
