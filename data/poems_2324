BEWARE
Beware of the little lies you tell
feels like being stabbed
with a dagger in the chest
Beware of the anger growing inside
feels like fire
burning through the veins
Beware through the years
it has grown to be a volcano
just waiting patiently to erupt
Beware of when it will erupt
through the will flow
an action from boiling anger
Beware of the action
because this anger will consume
and destroy whatever it crosses
whatever is in it's path
it will take vengeance
