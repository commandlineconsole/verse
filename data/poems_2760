THE SADNESS OF UNCERTAINTY
THE SADNESS OF UNCERTAINTY
The sadness of uncertainty
Troubles tomorrow-
We live without knowing what will be
We dream and cannot know when and how
The world will bring us to a different place-
We try to feel we have our lives in our hands
But they go to places we never thought of-
Unthinking Reality
Is our portion
And what we become
A mystery we ourselves
Can only partly understand
Even in retrospect.
