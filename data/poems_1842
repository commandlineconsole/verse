FOOTSTEPS
I rise up and rush down
To my sheer surprise I   see
Nothing has been broken
Still I hear a sound of cracking.
Being dog tired and bog down
I lay down hard myself
Still and motionless
Yet to my great surprise
I can see the red flames
With all my  closed eyes.
I jerk to empty my head
And closed all the doors to forget
Yet to my sheer surprise
I sense in my sound sleep
Some ones footsteps.
