DEVILS' RIDE
Pavement moving like lightning in a storm
Emotions running through just the same
Not a care in the world mind blown all to Hell
At every thought of your name
I don’t care anymore, I just don’t care
Alcohol flowing through my veins
Like the fuel that pushes my ride
Exhaust pipes pounding its mechanical roar
Pain and emotions I’m trying to hide
I don’t care anymore, I just don’t care
The thought of my kids fly by like the wind
Indifferent to any pain I might cause
Feed me more of this numbing high
We’ll meet later on the Devil’s death bus
I don’t care anymore, I don’t care
The smell of carbon burning through the night
Like the breathe that leaves from inside
Yearning for more of the Devils’ fuel
Unbeknownst this is your last ride
I don’t care anymore, I don’t care
