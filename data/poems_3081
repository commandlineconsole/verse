IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
In the silence of the night
I will come to you
In the silence of the night
I will lie with you
In the silence of the night
Your dreams will be fulfilled
In the silence of the night
In the beauty of the night
I will be gentle with you
In the beauty of the night
Two hearts will beat as one
In the beauty of the night
Our love will be fulfulled
In the beauty of the night
In the sorrow of your night
I will cherish you
In the sorrow of your night
Two minds will think as one
In the sorrow of your night
Our love will be consumated
In the sorrow of your night
In the glory of our night
I will pleasure you
In the glory of our night
Two spirits will coalesce
In the glory of our night
Our love will be eternal
In the glory of our night.
