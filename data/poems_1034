LIFE'S SMALL JOY
Smile and give others your smile
Let others enjoy in trouble's pile
Love 'n be loved my dear
This is what makes life rare
Help and get help all along
Give and take when things are wrong
And then you'll see you'll enjoy
All life's small fun 'n joy
And once if you'll learn to count
Life's joy deposited in your account
Then you'll see happiness all around
Surrounding you with joy on the ground.
