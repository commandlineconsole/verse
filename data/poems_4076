FEARS
Fear of love,
Fear of hate,
Fear of staying out to late.
Fear of doing wrong,
Fear of hearing that song.
Fear of seeing them get along.
Fear of seeing her face.
Fear of making your day,
Fear of what she would say.
Fear of seeing her cry,
Fear of looking her in the eye,
Fear of seeing her die.
Fear of being left behind,
Fear of going blind
Fear of whats inside,
Fear of what she has to hide.
