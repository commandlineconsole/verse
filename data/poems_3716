CARING
People say the best thing in the world is to care
Maybe it's because I care so much
That it isn't good
But when I care, I love
It's Caring that has gotten me to where I am
Going in circles
Wondering, telling myself
That this is sickening
Wondering what is happening behind my back
Why I'm still strung up
On the past
Is it the inability to move on?
Or the ability to care
That is destroying me
Eating, tearing away at my happiness
Ive been told more times than I care to admit that
She shouldn't be the one to define me
But I let her
Because loving and caring is all I know
It's all that keeps me going
It's what helps me sleep
Warm illuminating thoughts of the past
But what's worse then caring, caring this much
Is knowing that it is what's deconstructing me
And letting it happen because I care too much
