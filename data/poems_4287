FEAR III
I let life be
I don't claim others
Trust me that mindset
Will never tear my from my brothers
Yet I still wonder
How I'm still standing here
Up on my two feet
Holding up against fear
Yet fear itself
Is still why I fear
That statement is old yet true
And I hold is near and dear
I swear I won't be consumed
Because fear only scares me
With fear, brave is assumed
But to me, it's a guarantee
