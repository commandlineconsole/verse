SHADOWS OF DESIRE, MIRRORS OF THE SOUL
Oh were I the breath that you take and lived in your heart, said he
Oh were you the blood thatâ€™s pounding passion in me, said she
Where I your hands that caress gloriously, he said with a sigh
Were you my lips that seek you hungrily, she said with a shy smile
Were I your fantasy, that makes you crave me, said he with rising passion
And were you the responding cry that receives me in delight, said she quietly
If this is the way it was meant to be, then who am I and who art thee
Shadows of desire, accepting each other, as we are
Mirrors of the soul, separate vessels
And one, in communion
