THE SWEET LIFE
I congratulate you in the way of living you command,
And the situation is cocoa, and vaster than chocolate,
As far as the envy is concerned, as well as the sweetness,
The bitter food and drink is concerning me lately.
O it tasted! O it hated! Are we not in absolute assurance
Of the polite entrance into a world of travel and trance.
O it requires a man of good to see the bad men out.
