SLIPPING THROUGH
I go around day to day
Nothing to look forward to
nothing to say
People shove past, no-one cares
They cant see the fire burn
The mighty flames that choke my mind
A mask covers it all
Engulfs and silences it
Making a fake mockery of my own pain
Allowing others to think im fine
If only they could care enough to see past the mask
Could see it fall
See me in this pain
Though no-one would care
Just like no-one cares that im slipping through
As the foundations crack
As my mind crumbles
As i silently cry myself to sleep
