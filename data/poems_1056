ACHILLES AND COBAIN
Those sworn in blood to live wild and die young,
And lend their wayward impulse in dry night,
Live on forever in their joys re-sung.
They take no heed of warning eye or tongue,
No spectres, nor the mortal moral, fright
Those sworn in blood to live wild and die young.
Although, too soon, their songs will leave the lung,
Their laughter and unhesitating sight
Live on forever in their joys re-sung.
Their eyes are fire, their hearts and nerves unstrung,
Inside them flows the stars and dancing light,
Those sworn in blood to live wild and die young.
Achilles and Cobain, and those among
The crowds that see beyond deathâ€™s woeful plight,
Live on forever in their joys re-sung.
The grey-haired damn failed dreams to which they clung
In words that know, with soon-forgotten spite,
Those sworn in blood to live wild and die young
Live on forever in their joys re-sung.
