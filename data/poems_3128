I AM
i am swept in a sea full of sorrow, fearan pain
i wonder if any man sheltered on this Earth can feel my wretchedness
i hear the death-noise of rancor hungry birds, instead of amiable laughter
i see an indolent feared soul left drowning fractiously in a deplored ebony desolation
i want the amiable largess joy of the all exalted and liberal God
i am swept in a sea full of sorrow, fear and pain
i pretend to be assuaged out in th epacified sapphire colored seas
i feel alone in this listless, reproached loveless world
i touch the obscured ivory clouds
i worry about the deplored icy cold rusted chains to my heart
i cry to rise to that eternal amiable joy that life born in thelove of God
i am swept in a sea full of sorrow, fear and pain
i understand theodious hunger that prudently tore my sea-weary soul
i say 'Praise th Holy Grace of Him who honored us.'
i dream of our altruistic thoughts turning to where our placated home is
i try to survive this fearful ebony fragile world
i hope of th magnanimous of Heaven
i am swept in a sea full of sorrow, fear and pain
