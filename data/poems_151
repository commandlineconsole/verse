LOVE IS
love is laughing through bad stomach and kidney pains,
love is halving each problem into multi grains
love is the avoidance of joining separate lanes
love is all
love is chatting for hours about stupid things
love is acting devilish as she wears angel wings
love is what comes from darkness and what sunshine brings
love is small
love is reading psalms and lines in the palms
love is in the scriptures and in both our arms
love is the imminence of water and the storm that calms
love is tall
love is 7 years of waiting
love has nothing to do with hating
love is at the end of living and the start of creating
love may fall
love is the eyes of amaranthine
love is never just yours, nor ever just mine
love is the age of rust in every old sign
love is all
love is the timeless moments between the sheets
love is the most beautiful thing and her bags full of wheat
love is when best friends via fresh bends are destined to meet
love is small
love is when funeral bells cease and newlife is born
love is the minutes of sunset, and the grandeur of dawn
love is the reason one wakes up, if ever at all?
love is tall
love is not the vibrant flower, it is the soil and  the seeds
love is not an overflowing garden, it is the toil and weeds
love is not associated with honour and greed
love may fall
love is your giggling, effervescent young child
love is your cheesecake, 'fluffy' and 'mild'
love is in the city, love is in the wild
love is all
love is in tents with the intention to light candles
love is assisting small fingers to open heavy door handles
love is secretly counting silver shine bangles
love is small
love is impossible to end this poem hereon
love is constant here, and 'never gone'
love is 'calling out, lets go, come on'
love is tall
love is hate for no one and peace for many
love is compassion, security for less than a penny
love is, loving my jenny
her love is all.
