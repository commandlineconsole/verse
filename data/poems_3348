NILGIRI GROVES
In the eucalyptus groves we walked
unsure about holding hands
You too concerned about the world
I too concerned about love
Several laps did we complete
But not a word was spoken
Silence played in the background
As my heart played in my throat
And all I could smell around us
Was this Nilgiri scented taboo...
