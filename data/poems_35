LOVE IS
Love it sees
Love it hears
Love it feels
For those in tears
Love accepts
Love it knows
Love releases
Love it flows
Love is open
Love is strong
Love’s courageous
With patience long
Love is lightness
Love is pure
Love is beauty
Love endures
Love’s compassion
Love is kind
Love’s  forgiving
When life is blind
Love it dances
Love has wings
Love it soars
Love it sings
Love is tender
Love is sweet
Love with time
Becomes love deep
Love is constant
Love transcends
Love is oneness
Love never ends
