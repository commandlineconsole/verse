DEATH TAKES HER AWAY
I still remember when
I walked through the door
Surprised by what I saw
Surprised tears didn't pour
She lay there talking to a ghost
I didn't understand
It's like her mind was lost
Somewhere in a fairytale land
I tried to play along
And sat down on her bed
She thought I was a stranger
It was too much water for me to tread
I watched helplessly in silence
As evil took over her body
Drowning in disbelief
And wondering, 'God, why me? '
How selfish, I know
For she was the one suffering
And nothing was all
That I had to bring
Not much was said between us
She continued talking to her 'friend'
I left regretting what I didn't do
But it was too late; tomorrow her life would end.
