THE LAST WORDS HE SAID......
i will be back for you
im the only one who cares about you
please don't hate me
i didn't mean to leave you
he never came back for her
he never cared for her
she never hated him
he left her and never came back
maybe she wanted him back
maybe she wanted him to care
maybe she loved him
maybe its her fault
he held her when she cried at night even though it was his fault.
he made her smile when he made her upset.
he cared about her when no one else did even though everything was his fault.
