COMRADE REVIVAL
cowardly, I heard them say
to do one two and three
and not A, B and C
my thoughts did not realy agree
not with the unity i see
'tis a comrade revival i'd say
a loss of life by a sword
with propaganda as the explaining word
is not to be swallowed by peristolisis,
and raising security concern
by the method they'll learn
to listen to what is of our concern,
is not a reason to run
or rather instill fear for us to quit
this is a comrade revival
never again
will fear subjugate our survival.
