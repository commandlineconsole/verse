SIMPLE PROMISE
A simple promise to a friend
Kept her with you till the end
From the simple times of laugh and chat, sitting their just thinking that
Time would stop with the clouds you watch
To the arguements you always had
She's concerned of your love for someone else
Your the only in my house
Growing up was easy, learning tough was not so great
Learning from all the mistakes that we make
The world is full of challenges, baby I'll face them with your bliss
Settled down for insolence, so I could live with you
I wanna love you, I do
I touched you so many times
By accident, well those were lies
The promise that I commit, allowed me not to live with it
We made it through so many troubled things, though
There's no repairing your damadged wings
I held your freezing hand as it grew colder still
As I bite my lip now holding back the tears
Of the love I've known for years
It ends this way, your body turns grey
Living life never was the same. Hard to believe
I can't remember you breathe
You always sunk my heart
A simple promise to a friend
Kept me waiting for the end
Every night and day, at the place where we had played
She's concerned of your love for someone else
Your the only in my house
