LET MY PASSION BE MY SOULMATE, TO WHOM I HYMN! !
Let my passion lend me some peace of mind,
when I throw tantrums and then hide.
Let my passion gather me a heap of courage,
when it becomes difficult to survive.
Let my passion be my crutches,
when my faith gets crippled after falling down from heights.
Let my passion be my eternal conscience,
at times of my wandering mind.
Let my passion be my bed of roses,
upon which I lie at night.
Let my passion be my enlightened side,
when darkness prevails in my life.
Let my passion be my cure,
when my sickness touches the height.
Let my passion be my hymn,
when the apparition of doubts cloud my sight.
Let my passion be my lover,
when I urge for lust at night.
Let my passion be my companion,
to cry with or to celebrate at times.
Let my passion be my mother,
teaching me to crawl, toddle, fall, stand and run in life.
Let my passion be a lap,
in which I cry, hide and naps for a while.
Let my passion be my food,
when I starve with hunger at times.
Let my passion be my wave,
when drought prevails in my life.
Let my passion be my giggle,
when my smile vanishes from my sight.
Let my passion be my voice.
when at times I go dumb being dominated by vice.
Let my passion be my thoughts,
when at times I go blank from inside.
Let my passion be my eyes,
when sometimes; because of too much brightness, I go blind.
Let my passion be my sanctum,
when I'm fed up of the voices coming from outside.
Let my passion be my heartbeat,
never leaving me forlorn even when I get chide from my sins.
Let my passion be my tomb,
in which I finally close my eyes.
Let my passion be immortal
2 b with my soul as an eternal togetherness.

Let me be the liquid of sanctity that resides,
In the divine bowl of its passion.

And finally let my readers decide,
Would I still be needing someone by my side? ?
