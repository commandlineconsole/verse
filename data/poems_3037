SORROW
Sorrow fills every ounce of my life
Arrows are your words, they pierce this Crimson heart,
Running from your mouth are those words longing to escape
Rest in silence, never let your words be free....
Once sorrow takes over, your words are not needed
Where has Crimson gone? look within sorrow to find the Crimson Prince.
