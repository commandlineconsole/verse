IF ONLY THE SUN WOULD RISE
If the sun would rise, I would be grateful.
Because a new day is starting.
Not like yesterday, or the day before;
A day when no one should be hateful.
If only the sun would rise,
I’d spend the day with you,
And maybe the night,
Until the day anew.
It would be so lovely,
If the sun would rise,
That maybe,
There would be a surprise.
I love you too much,
To let you go up to the skies,
If only the sun would rise.
If only the sun would rise,
I’d spend the day with you,
And maybe the night,
Until the day anew.
I would appreciate your every thought,
And then right on the spot,
To our surprise,
The morning sun will rise.
