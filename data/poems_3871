COLDNESS
i am cold, i am scared and i am in the dark
Ive been cold for the longest time i would like some warmth
i am going to freeze i am going to die and nobody cares
they just sit there and laugh, laugh like i am nothing
nobody cares nobody has ever cared whether i die or live
and now I'm going to die because they didn't care enough
to save me from the coldness
