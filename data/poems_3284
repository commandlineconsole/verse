PAWN
Pawn,
pawn pieces
Movements contemplated,
The love of pawn’s parent concerned with an opening,
‘tis no opening that assures any ending
The love of pawn’s entourage concerned with rules,
‘tis not any rules that sing to us a strategy
The love of pawn’s protection concerned with its safety
‘tis no veritable truth found without risk
The love of pawn’s development concerned with its position,
‘tis no position developed in the absence of  a journey
The love of pawn’s potential concerned with answers,
‘tis no answer more potent than its question
Though mastery of life’s game not possible,
individual movements easily grasped
In the great chess boards of life,
