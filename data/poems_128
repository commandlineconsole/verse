SOMEONE LOVES ME
Woke up with love on my sheets
love on my lips
love on my cheeks
love on my breath
love in my blood
love like dna  everywhere i go it sticks to surfaces
ALL BECAUSE SOMEONE LOVES ME
Love like clots in my throat
in my veins and speech
Love victimizing me
holding me against my will
ALL BECAUSE SOMEONE LOVES ME
Love on my clothes
I wash then twice
I wash them thrice
Love leaves crimson stains
I scrub I soak I repeat
ALL BECAUSE SOMEONE LOVES ME
Love in my bones
love outlining my flesh
love polishing the crease of my neck
Love in the place of my spine
holding me up
invertebrate and all
People staring
opinions pave my street
ALL BECAUSE SOMEONE LOVES ME
