COULD BE A CRUEL MOTHER
My husband’s mother loved,
Cared and nursed my son,
More than she did her son,
Pouring her sweats and time.
Someone caring my son
Must be a source of pride
To me beside a relief.
Yet I felt most perturbed.
The child grew under her care;
The child found a good time
To be found near her
With its back towards me.
The lady must exit.
She did as I planned.
The child fell sick and felt
Bad about her absence.
I’ve been much relieved.
The child has much grieved.
I became much spirited
And the child, dispirited.
The welfare of the child
Was not my concern, ho!
My sole concern was that
It was under my spell.
Aren’t I a cruel mother?
