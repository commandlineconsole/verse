I LOVE YOU
I love you
I love you for being my friend
I love you
I love you for hurting me
I love you
I love you for listening to my problems
I love you
I love you for being my greatest problem
I love you
I love you for listening to my needs
I love you
I love you for not being here in my greatest time of need
I love you
I love you for all the good times we had
I love you
I love you for making this the worst time of my life
I love you
I love you for showing me what love is
I love you
I love you for showing me what hate is
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you that I hate you
