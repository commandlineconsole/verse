MY SWEETHEART
To feel loved takes anxiety and fear away
to be cuddled with love, to be accepted, is
the most wonderful thing that can happen
I look at you and FEEL the rays of wonder
I touch you and experience delight and joy
I listen to you - heart melting at the sound
Of your voice, even when you get angry or
frustrated - love makes me feel delighted
When you turn lightning eyes on me and I
return the bliss I feel, your lips start curling
into a smile against your will
When I stroke your back and kiss your neck,
you sigh in content and delight
Deep inside my heart I feel like a new being
renewed, energised, recreated by pure love
existing in a dimension of pure confidence
Created by you â€“ you are my superman, my
wizard, my guardian angel, my sweetheart...
