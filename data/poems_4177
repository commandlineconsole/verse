B: X: HOPE CONCERN
Fear by hope was eased,
Requiring that easing plight
Came and went at random,
Polishing fear's might.
Fear was much too proud
And that caused hope concern:
Hope had all the brains,
Fear no hope to learn.
Hope concerned its brains with fear,
Expressed fear so well,
Surprise hope found at any turn
Kept hope out of hell.
