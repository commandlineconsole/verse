NOBODY KNOWS
nobody knows me
knows about my love
nobody loves me
that love is pure
nobody think of me
the think without sadness
and sadness
nobody speaking about me
speaking about my abilities
and about my weaknesses
nobody sits near me
that sitting is just for live
nobody hear me
hear that cry
that cry of sadness
that sadness of losing
and the losing in love
nobody wants me
wanting just for me
and nothing other
nobody walk with me
walk with me without enmity
nobody holds my arms
nobody thinks of my pain
that pain in my heart
the pain of broken
yeah, the broken heart
nobody forgive me
forgive me
for all that i was
and for all that i am
nobody wants tell me
i was wrong in that love
yeah pal I'm nobody...
