THOUGHTS OF LOVE AND FEAR
The thoughts behind thoughts
Binary rays of love and fear
Projected into the prism of experience
Rainbows of emotion swaying in waves of colour
Love of Love
Cosmic thoughts spiralling helical through my city streets
Dancing alone
Thinking alone
With the radio
Love of Fear
Locomotive thoughts lined up on rails
Squeezing steam into the night
Pumping acrid whooshes   of smoke
Fear of Love
Thoughts spiralling down like water
Into the black hole of my bathtub
Feeding underground rivers of darkness
Fear of Fear
Belly scraping thoughts dragging
Over broken bits of concrete
Obstacles, tentacles, pentacles
Love of Love
Cosmic thoughts spiralling helical through Cities to Be
Dancing alone
Being alone
With the radio
