JOY
Joy is in heart and mind
Joy is for eyes to find
Joy is found everywhere
Joy is when you soul-care!
Joy is when you well seek
Joy is for mild and meek
Joy is Nature divine
Joy is rain and sunshine
Joy is in each good thought
Joy is in success wrought
Joy is God’s love for man
Joy is in God’s life-span
Joy is in bud and frond
Joy is in brooks and pond
Joy is in things God made
Joy’s beauty cannot fade
