AFFAIRS OF THE HEART
Affairs of the heart concerning that of great wondrous love
Perhaps are not meant for me
Alas, some in this world are meant not to fall folly
To such perils concerning the heart
For there once was a time I thought my true love was mine
Though a mere halo on the finger doth not make it so
For any wink of the eye or shake of the hip as she passes him by
Can ensnare him into a web full of lies
And should he choose to stay yours, truth be told
All that's left is a mere shell of the man he once was
Should you choose to accept and give your forgiveness
Tis you who will pay for his vast indiscretion, tis you who will pay in the end
Thus this treacherous lesson did I learn in the most difficult of ways
Twas a long pathway of submission I did travel upon
Not allowing myself to see the truth of the matter
Only longing to salvage what had been torn asunder
Now that my heart nor my mind no longer can turn a blind eye
Tis a rebellious nature my heart hath taken on
For oh how very long have I longed
To march to the beat of my very own drum
To find courage and strength to be able to say
I can achieve what ere I desire today
So long as I dwell not upon affairs of the heart
Concerning that of great wondrous love
Alas, for some are not meant to fall folly
To such perils concerning the heart
Thus I query these things are not meant for me
