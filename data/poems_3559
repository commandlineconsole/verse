SOMETIMES
sometimes concern is misunderstood
sometimes friendship is dishonored
sometimes words are not kept
sometimes feelings are not respected
sometimes favors are forgotten
sometimes truth is misconstrued
facts broken and bent
to create an image
a story
that never was..
Sometimes trust is broken
names spoilt
reputations killed
because someone was not the person they promised they were
at times like this
one wishes.. there was
a meter to judge
to help assess
to see what people are inside
a people detector
how easy that would be..
a little bit of wishful thinking
sometimes...
