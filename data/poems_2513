HALLOWEEN
Halloween
A day I dread
Thoughts of the previous one
Make me shiver of sadness and anger
Anger towards you
You stood me up
Sure, we were going through a rough time
But I didn't think you gave up
Guess I wasn't worth the distance
Sitting at home
In my costume
Watching movies
Waiting and waiting and waiting
Its the worst possible feeling
Not feeling loved, wanted
I'm not that girl anymore
Who waits forever
Now its one year later
Can you tell me what you're doing?
I can tell you what I'm NOT doing
I'm no longer waiting
