I FEEL THE JOY
There is a day in the night
Within beautiful seeing
With the moon close and bright
In our heart times being
Every hour is staying
To times in night falling
As the wind outside´s playing
To the night and dark calling
I feel the joy within me
Where imaginary landscapes go
With the wings of heaven free
In the moonlight hours glow
Every depth has its touch
With its hours of purple sky
In the glow of heaven’s torch
As the nightfall again dies
(Chorus)
I feel the joy within me
Where imaginary landscapes go
With the wings of heaven free
In the moonlight hours glow
Nights and days are everything
In our finds and our waking
Every joy to the inside bring
With the colors of nature making
Every hour is staying
To times in night falling
As the wind outside´s playing
To the night and dark calling
(Chorus)
I feel the joy within me
Where imaginary landscapes go
With the wings of heaven free
In the moonlight hours glow
I feel the joy…
