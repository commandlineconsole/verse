TOUCHED BY YOU
Touched by words not witholding passion
Caressing sweet thoughts, where the light of passion flickers in the recess
of a mind once doused dorment feelings
embers ignite a language that heightens senses
Steaming up views with articulating prose
Enchantment growing with each line
They say what lies behind us, and what lies before us are tiny matters
compared to what lies within us.
The glowing passion is but a reflection of our inner fire stoked by excitement of the new.
