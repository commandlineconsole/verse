153.DIFFERENT VISIONS-A KIDâ€™S STUFF
No care for the tree
Drenching in the rain
Shivering hard but
Sheltering a lot
No care for the flowers in the garden
Blooming everyday
Spreading fast the fragrance
Invigorating all but with everlasting nudity
No care for the world
Looking at me through its lenses
Kicking and gagging but
Providing no succor brutalizing the soul
No care for my body
Venting through the nine holes
Under the control of the senses
And bulldozing the spirit
No care for the god
Father of the creatures
Sub serving the rich but
Vandalizing the rest
