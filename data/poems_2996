CHOU NU ER
In days when I was young and didn't know the taste of sorrow
To write the latest odes I forced myself to tell of sorrow.
Now that I understand the taste of sorrow altogether
Instead I say, 'What a cool day! Such lovely autumn weather!'
When young, I knew not the taste of sorrow,
But loved to mount the high towers;
I loved to mount the hight towers
To compose a new song,urging myself to talk about sorrow.
Now that I have known all the taste of sorrow,
I would like to talk about it, but refrain;
I would like to talk about it, but refrain,
And say merely: 'It is chilly; what a fine autumn!'
