AFRAID
I am not afraid of spiders or of the nights
I am not afraid of bees or scared of heights
I am not scared of the pain of death
I feel I could accept my last breath
I am not afraid to show emotion
to live my life and cause commotion
I am not too scared to love my friends
even though it always ends
I am not afraid of what I feel
just cannot tell when it is real
None of these things I really fear
for what I fear comes from within
I am afraid that after falling for you
I will be left alone, crushed, broken in two
I fear I deserve no love
no one sent from above
I fear I cant better myself
for the good of my health
I am afraid to feel cold and alone
after being so close, and feeling at home
lastly I fear what I may have become
All the mistakes I have made that cant be undone
these fears keep me awake at night
and fill my heart with a chilling fright
every day I must face my fears
but I will be strong, no one will see any tears
