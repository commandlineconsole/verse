CRIMSON DELIGHT
Children of the night roam free
As wolf songs echo in the distance
Their deep melodious songs reach in the night
Softly tainting the translucent light
Children of the night speak to me
needing their presence dark, dark presence of death
Ill linger here waiting for crimson delight
Ill follow you, take you, and hold you tight
To my pining breast, lips on your neck
Let your sweet crimson, taint me again
Let your emotions fill me, rid of such ill thoughts
That eludes, your purest self
I am a creature of the night
I kill to survive be my conduit tonight
My love, you belong here with me
The crimson delight flows in me
My blood pulses for you as a beating heart
Darkness is twisted, intertwined in both of us
Children of the night roam free
Lets drown in crimson delight as the sun rises again
