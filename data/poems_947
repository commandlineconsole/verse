IS THERE ANY WAY TO WRITE A POEM OF JOY IN OLD AGE
IS THERE ANY WAY TO WRITE A POEM OF JOY IN OLD AGE?
Is there any way to write a poem of Joy in old age?
Is there any way to truly feel free
When the pains have already come to stay?
What is our Life
If we cannot
Even nearer to the end
Know Joy?

The laughter of small children
Brightens those homes
Blessed by their visit.
