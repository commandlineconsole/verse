LOOKING FOR LOVE
Do i dare look for love
Are you sure its out there
where do i look where do go
Love can be a number of things
I believe love can be found in many forms
What kind of love are you searching for
The love that makes your heart skip a beat
Or the love of everything that is beautiful
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Love comes unexpectedly and leaves just as quickly
Lost love is very painful
No love is the same
Passionate love is the one we long for
The love for ones own child is forever
Love is giving love is taking
Can i find love waking down the street
I found love once but lost it where did i put it
Young love sweethearts embracing
Forbidden love do we dare some do
Is the word love used to loosely
Has the word lost all its meaning
Thank you i would love that piece of cake
Can one truly love someone forever
Yes love can be for ever
Sometime we fall in and out of love with same person
So don't look for love love will find you
Love leaves us breathless
Sometimes renders us helpless
But were would we be without love
wondering aimlessly
