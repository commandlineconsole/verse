TODAY HATE IS TAKING OVER ME
Today is one of those days
Hate is the only thing in my head
Everything I push away for this day
Today, today I just want to be alone
While the anger  taking over me
Instead of the sadness I use to love
Now I’m alone feel the cold air going in my room
Feeling nothing but my heart betting
Thinking what I should do to get away for the anger out of me
so I’m sitting here writing away make myself think so the anger
can go away until I need it once again
