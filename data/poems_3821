Guess what
Don't care
I'm right
You'll spare
You are
Crazy
And I am
A lady
All the
Cool things
You break
I clean
When will
You be
Respectful
To me
I'll make
One last
Prediction
You'll pass
You stink
I know
You'll be
Down low
Guess what
Don't care
I'm right

Guess what (Guess what)
Don't care (Don't care)
I'm right (I'm right)
You'll spare (You'll spare)
All this
Time I
Am trying
To tell
You that
I don't
Care what
You think
All the
Time I
Am right
You die
Joking
You look
Like you
Could use
A day too
Guess what
Don't care
I'm right
You'll spare
