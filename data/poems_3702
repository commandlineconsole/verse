I DIDNT CARE
I always treated them important, they treated me unimportant..
I showed them they are special, they made me to think that I was nothing..
I cared them a lot, they didn't care at all..
I stopped caring, they didn't care this time too..
But I I felt better..
I felt better that I wasn't cared when I didn't
Than I wasn't cared when I did care..
