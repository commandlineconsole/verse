A  THING   CALLED   HOPE
In  all  worthwhile  endeavors,
No  matter  size  or  scope.
It  shall  either  have  a  life,
Or  die,  a  thing  called  hope.
It  all  depends  on  caring.
Those  willing  to  take  part.
Hope,  to  be  sustained  at  all;
Requires  a  beating  heart.
Each  heart  that  God  created,
Has  value  each  in  turn.
When  called  upon  to  voice  it,
Don't  shrink  from  your concern.
Its  in  those special  moments,
When  life  gives  you  a   choice;
You'll  either  sit  in  silence,
Or  stand  and  lend  your  voice.
It's  with  the  inspiration
Derived  from  what  you  do.
Others  may  participate
And  make  your  dream  come  true.
If  you  need  inspiration
To  act  on  your  concern,
Just  take  note  of  your  children,
And  how  they  come  to  learn.
They  look  to  you  for  guidance,
To  see  what  they  should  do.
How  to  be  a  citizen.
Concerned,  what  do  they  do?
It's  now  your  time  for  choosing;
Don't  sit, and  cry, and  mope.
It  shall  either  have  a  life,
Or  die,  a  thing  called  hope.
