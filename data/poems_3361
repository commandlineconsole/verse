TAKE ME
take me to your arms
shower me with your kindness
pour me the dews of courage
and bless me your concern…
take me to your heart
a kind heart am longing
a sincere feeling am wishing
a true compassion from your promise
take me…take me with you
leave the clouds behind the tempest
humble virtue leads the way
loosen the doubts within me...
expressing oneself is one way to ease ones burden..this is precisely not an interesting poem but for me, it means a lot..this is the simplest way to say ''thanks to all of my friends...thanks for your concern''...
