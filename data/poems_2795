IT IS THE RAIN TRICKLING
always remember the sound of the trickling rain
always pay attention to its sadness
always greater than yours
the seemingly endless trickling of the rain
at night
when you are alone in your room
notice the notes
to make it a very sad song
appeasing your
heart
every trickle has a meaning
subsumed in another
trickle
mind it well
and you will never be alone again
mind the sound of sadness
get used to its rhythm
understand
the meaning hidden in every
granule of waterdrops
then, you will fear nothing
in this chant
this poetic trance this awareness
of falling
and its meaning
only then will you understand
what sunshine means what rising means
what everything else
to someone like you
