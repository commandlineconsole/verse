NO MORE ROUTINE
In your heart you wear love
Like a sundown falling sky
In the cloudlets far above
Into a sunset going lullaby
When dreams are coloring light
Thru the shadows of a while
Before morning comes on bright
In daybreak freshly style
In your heart you wear dreams
Building days of much spring
Like a river falling streams
Within your eyes of freshness sing
Remember joys of gone things
All the days that light dawn
In the time tomorrow brings
Thru rising days silver swan
In your heart remember me
Every teardropp days have kissed
All our love joy found free
And our thoughts now missed
Every day that is now gone
Into bouquets of yesterdays
Love and joy forever on
In their flights of many ways
