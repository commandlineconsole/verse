ANGER
I need to relive my anger, it is  killin me inside
It is probaly cus im full of pride
lots of people make me so mad
Even my friend my boyfriend and my dad
I want to just fight my anger away
But solve my problem with fighting is not ok
Just leave me alone, im tired of u all
You pick me up just to see me fall
This is how it will always be
I'll have a life full of yall messin with me
