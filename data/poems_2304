RUNNING
You lie to me again
You think I’ll never know
With every lie you tell me
My anger only grows
It bubbles under the surface
I want no one to see
The anger that is simmering
Right inside of me
My anger starts to heat
You act like you’ve done no wrong
But you did
I trusted you all along
My anger consumes me
I am blind with rage
I focus on my book
As I turn the page
I usually let my anger seep
Slowly out of me
But today it won’t wait
It longs to be free
I start yelling
I just explode
Everyone is staring
I don’t know where to go
I start running
Away from you
You cause pain
I know what you can do
I’m still running
From my pain
I will keep running
Until we meet again
