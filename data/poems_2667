LIVING WITH OUT THESE MOMENTS OF SADNESS
Do I need these memories
these moments of thoughts of the past
can I live with in the now and handle my sadness
that some how means nothing
my tears flow as if I all ready now
moment after moment pass and I steal of my
questions can I live with out these moments of sadness
that help me cope with the thing that larks deep with in my self
the one thing I hide from and setting it apart from my own reality
having the dilution that it's real when the people around me now other wise and living with out these moments of sadness only I can make that my reality
