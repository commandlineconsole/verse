A PLEASURE ABOVE MEASURE
Friend,
it is my pleasure to be your friend -
a pleasure above measure!
Look at my face,
surely you won't find grimace;
Consider ye my eye,
you won't find a proud 'I'
Measure ye my nose
that breathes like red rose;
Measure ye my mouth,
so fresher than breeze of south;
Count ye now my teeth -
a force to reckon with!
Friend,
to be your friend?
My pleasure,
a pleasure above measure!
