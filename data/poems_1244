CROWN
The crown deserves a jewel of pure delight,
Enacting royalty of the highest order.
Fully taught the monarch presides over his palace
And his land of glory, the crownâ€™s holy place.
A holy child has been born. Due to holier work,
The strange men of chivalry travel and flee
To bid them good fortune. Children work as well.
The crown is for the prince to come, the overwhelming,
His highness is a spectacle of the highest delight.
