THAT CRACK WE CALL LOVE
Your(My)    breath in break
Your(My)    heart in beak
our eyelids blink; blink
though the light of noon
we are blind
totally blind
ease and bless
for our souls
but crabby mad
for our minds
so that..
that crack we call love
we call love
we need love
we shout love
whispering love
smiling love
crying  love
sing for love
dreaming love
feight for love
live  for love
die for love
love for love
life for love
love for life
and all that
crack..
you call
i call
we call
