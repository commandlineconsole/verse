UNDERSTAND THE STARS
Understand and know the reasons behind me,
Raise the certain issues with frank discussion.
I look into hearts with a  certain praise,
Look at me now that you are gone.
One image is one freedom of the liberty,
Inside this shell is another egg that hatches
And sheds the living spheres, always a yoke
Concerns me.
I have gone tomorrow, for the beloved speaks
To me in the day and night,
Feeling my soul as a departed one,
Death has captured the certain one,
Dead men and women concern me more
Than the rest of them.
Sleep in your sleep O perfect one,
Live according to the realm,
Speak with accusations of slight
Love,
Now that the founder of your faith
Has been.
In your deep sleep
See me shine like the stars
Of the night, of the star
In the day, and the stars of the say.
