LOVE
the air we breath,
LOVE
longing still not shown,
LOVE
a simple kiss,
LOVE
laughter form stories heard,
LOVE
I miss you, I miss you so,
LOVE
as vows bonds untold,
LOVE
body’s entwined eternally of mind,
LOVE
a touch out of the darkness,
LOVE
given never taken,
LOVE
always euphoric in biology,
LOVE
then turn away when words are crossed,
LOVE
no angare ever taken to,
LOVE
is silent and still,
LOVE
pain again and again,
LOVE
passion can stop and kill,
LOVE
mornings together,
LOVE
as well as daylights end,
LOVE
life’s long companion,
LOVE
till we meet again.
