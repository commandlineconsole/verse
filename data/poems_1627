INTO BLISS
Between the stars comes moonlight
Mirror of a mind
Image of tempest fruit
Desire deeper than any volcanic fire
Song of Solemn
Color of regal red apples of summer
I am the broken mountains of Eden
Your toes in my mouth
Your black jewel fingernails
Your eyes of sapphire flames
When you find your love
Never take her for granted
Fever, malaise, love is never quenched
Door into pleasures of unity
Halves meeting in the ragged world
Love and joy amidst the thorns
Sensuality beyond pleasure
The two shall become one
Some never go there
Some have been but have fallen
Some stay and share the garden
Your kisses a slice of heaven
Love is the flame of angels
Coming home into bliss
