WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT LOVE
Love is not
Always exchanging pleasantries
It requires greater love
To stand by and support
During unpleasant and
More demanding situations
Love is not
Always being presented with
Most desired gifts
It requires greater love
To understand why a gift
Did not come up
And in the right time
Love is not
Always the unison of
Two bodies to copulate
And co-create
It requires greater love
To appreciate when the loved one
Is undergoing a stress
And requring just a caress
Love is beyond, far beyond
Satisfying these
Emotional, materialistic and
Physical requirements
Real Love
Helps the other
Grow spiritually stronger
After each demonstration
Of 'Love'
Love is
Nothing but the
Unmasked naked hate
Love is
To feel the liberty
To say “I hate you”
To the person loved
And only to declare the next moment
“I love you”
With a passionate kiss
And allowing a similar liberty
To the person loved
Love is not a lost liberty
But it is its demonstration
Love is
Freedom to share
Anything one has
Including the very self
At the same time
Not pitting efforts to share
With no expectations
From the person loved
Love is not a bond but
A freedom to be bound
Love is
An ecstasy
Only to be felt and experienced
Normally not explained
Beyond the realms of understanding
Enjoyed only by the persons in love
Keeping them high
And above
Love is not a burden
It is a float
Love and be loved
Enjoy liberty, freedom and ecstasy
