LOVE
Love is chocolate
Love is sweets and honey
Love is sometimes for your heart
Love is sometimes for the money
Love is passionate
Love is blind
Love is destined
Love is cruel and kind
Love is forever
Love is for a night
Love is fading
Love is at first sight
Love is unrequited
Love is for another
Love is not returned
Love is not to be smothered
Love is dangerous
Love is right
Love is wrong
Love is a fight
Love is complicated
Love is here and there
Love is in you and me
Love is everywhere
Love is broken
Love is true
Love is for me
Love is for you
