WARM AND SPECIAL
Warm and special
Little flower
Close to my heart
In its colored song
You are true like the wind
Where you reach to the air
Every joy is your bouquet
Thru the day and year
Every heart to pleasure
In your wake
Warm and special
For the hour
Close now you are
Your beauty I long
From the blossom
Of your little star
When I have you to me near
Every joy is your color
When the summer is here
And the wind in breezy hollers
With the pleasures you make
