THESE TUNES
the calming music makes me feel sleepy wanting to dream
i sit and type away looking at these messages pop up my thoughts are
wondering asking what is right and what is wrong
all i can do is listen to this song the anger plays on my thoughts
the quite noise that plays over and over keeps
me sober I'm trying to let go the anger is subsiding the music is blinding
blinding my thoughts maybe i can sleep
my thoughts still speak of a tune
music blocking the sounds of anger in my head
I'm going to lay down in my bed
looking for a tune that is calming to my head
sweet dreams its all in my head
Trippy: ]
