FIRE
Fire, fire, burning bright, cackling, cackling with pure delight,
Fire, thou art cruelly dark and blessedly bright,
Fire, fire, The Bringer of Life,
Why dost ye cause such strife?
For thee art Fire, not Payne, not Death,
Fire, fire, bringing light, Fear is thy only delight,
Thou dost nurture it with a lover's plight,
But how doth thee enjoy such things, if thou art a Bringer of Life?
Life and Love,
Payne and Death,
Dark and Light.
THAT, is what thou artâ€¦
