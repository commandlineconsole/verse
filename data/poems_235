LOVE LOVING YOU
Love is just love
Loving you, is just loving you
No! loving you is to take
My breath from me to you
Share our flesh together
Live in our own world
Owning our own planet
Creating our own platform
Love loving you
Love is courtesy untouchable
It is a revealed pleasure
It is a measure of who you are
It is a destiny to our hearts
It is a period of happiness
It is a presence of ourselves as Angels
Love loving you
Lets drive this limo together
And live this outrageous life together
Lets be wise and wiser in this name â€¦.love
Love loving you
Love loving you
