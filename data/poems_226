LOVE, LOVE, LOVE
Love, love, love
I hear it everywhere
Why is it so great
I hear it here and there
Love, love, love
I see it everywhere
In poems or in letters
I see it here and there
Love, love, love
I feel it everywhere
Where couples are around
I feel it in the air
Love, love, love
I see it in your eyes
When I first looked at you
I pictured paradise
Love, love, love
That's all I know
That keeps my heart with you
Love please don't let go
