SOLDIER'S 'OF THE IRAQI WAR'
I've thought about this country
This fighting, the war
Things that never really
Concerned me before
I've thought about our military
their struggles, their lives
And how hard it must be
On their families, their wives
The things they endure
For us all to be free
We take for granted
Everyday, you and me
Their without the ones
That truelly care
But have a bond with their brothers
Thats beyond compare
They watch their comrades
Fall in vain
Holding onto much more
than just the pain
They carry the scars of war each day
With not many a thankyou along the way
They stand with there backs
Straight and tall at the door
With no fear in their eyes
When its again time to deplore
Straight into battle, into the core
Our Strong Brave Soldiers, 'of the Iraqi War'.
Dedicated to ALL our military men and women...Thankyou for what you endure for us all to be free.
