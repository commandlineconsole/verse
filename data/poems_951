TRIBUTE TO A JOYFUL SOUL
Lively spirit
Happy-sad soul
Child but woman
Erratic....but in control
Like a bird....with no home
Even still giving others such comfort and love
Voice of an angel
Soul of a poet
Strength and wisdom and love and support
And joy. Joy always. Love down deep in her soul.
Such a blessing in my life, my dear sweet friend.
I wish you a return of the joy and happiness you give to the world.
