LIFE
What puzzle is life
With joys and pleasures
Its pain and strife
Without counts and measures
And more than that
It comes and goes
For slim or fat
It never slows
Get it if you want
Or you will simply lose
Don’t say that you can’t
You have no choice to choose
Learn from pain to get a pleasure
And make your life an eternal treasure
