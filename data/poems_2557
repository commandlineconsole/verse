SADNESS IS A MAJOR THEME OF MINE
Sadness is a major theme of mine
I am sad a lot
I am not sure why -
My father was the saddest person I have ever known
Perhaps its that-

But life is sad
It has so much sadness in it-
Yesterday a very good friend of mine
Was pronounced incurably ill
So many friends of our recently
Have become very ill-
Aging brings much sadness with it-
So much sadness -
Inside I have too much joy too and peace and calm
I have those things also-
But sadness is always here or waiting to come.
