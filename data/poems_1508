I WANT TO GO BACK
I want to go back
Back to the age of childhood
where there were no worries
No work, no whimper
I want to revert back
Back to the era of pleasure
Where there was only pleasure
Only toys and games
I want to step back
Back to the time of truly happiness
Where everything used to impart happiness
Happiness that elevated the soul
I want to move back
Back to the moments of joy
Where mother's lap was the best thing
Sades moments were the broken toys
I wished I could go back
To regain all those pleasures
To touch the sky
To kiss the ground
To taste that food again
I could only dream
I could only wish.
