FEAR
Forever we are bound by fear
to live each day by its creed
to never forget we are here
and if i'm cut i will bleed
too late it seem is my love for life
its fear that has taken my will
to easy it is to forget whats right
cause fear keeps my heart concealed
it seems hope is fear's adversary
shining light when there is no other
though it seem to be quite contrary
when in fear we come together
though i've conquered my fear
i'm stronger and i have risin
its my ambition that is greater than my fear
yet my fear is greatest in my ambition
