A LITTLE CONTROL
Hug me from behind,
take me by surprise
pull me close
hold me tight
take a little control
kiss me gently
take a little control
and hold me baby.
hug me from behind.
sneak up on me
let me feel your body
up against mine.
let me feel your hands,
around my waist
take me by surprise.
when im infront of you
pull me in
pull me clsoe
like you want me
and never
want to let go.
hold me tight
and make that my place
in life.
Take a little control
let me feel your lips
take a little control
those soft lushous lips
take a little control
and pull me in
hold me tight
kiss me gently
take controlbaby
hug me from behind
take me by surprise
pull me close
hold me tight
take a little control
kiss me gently
take a little control
take a
take a
take a little control
and hold me baby
take a little
control.
