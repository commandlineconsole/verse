DO NOT FEAR
Do not fear
My friends
For I am here
Do not fear
Do not fear
My friends
For although I may be dead
All is not lost.
Do not fear
My friends
Consider me to be sleeping
For I sleep, but for a while.
Do not fear
My friends
All is not lost
For I am here
Do not fear
My friends
For I am here
Waiting for you to speak.
