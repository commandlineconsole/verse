ANGER WITHIN ME
My anger is not love …
My anger is drinking my life away.
My anger is killing someone who hurt me big.
My anger does one thing never  loves.
My anger is ramming your head through a glass door of my use to be home.
When your are mad you do stupid things, stupid things that are stupid.
When mad you don’t feel nothing anger we all have
anger you cant change.
When I am mad stay, stay away from everyone.
My anger can kill because you do stupid things
when you are mad  filled with ANGER
