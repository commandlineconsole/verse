LOVE IS
Love is quick Love is long
Love is what we have it'll never be wrong
Love is powerful Love is sweet
Love is that connection when our lips meet
Love is wonderful Love is grace
Love is everlasting, at a never ending pace
Love is lust Love is devotion
Love is our most powerful emotion
Love is a hold Love is an embrace
Love is being touched by your simple grace
Love is tender Love is a dream
Love is how all of life should seem
Love is for so many but finds so few
My Love is lucky because my Love is you.
