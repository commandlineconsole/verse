A FAMILIAR SITUATION
The procedure reeks,
With a familiar situation.
The needy are depicted,
As inflicting their own special 'needs'.
As if they could not wait to become impoverished,
By those who advertise their philanthropic ways.
To show a public concern with a donated tax free gift!

To show a public concern with a donated tax free gift!
With another round of photo ops,
Promoting generousity and involvement...
With the assistance of highlighting 'instructored',
Self impowerment.
The procedure reeks,
With a familiar situation.
