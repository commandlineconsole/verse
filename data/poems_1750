A TIE OF FRIENDSHIP
A friend is a treasure
A friend is a pleasure
A friend is a true gift
That gives our life a lift
For all our smiles
And our trouble piles
Are known to them
And with prayer's hem
They wish us well
Wherever they dwell
And that is why
Friendship is a tie
That give us pleasure
That is a great treasure.
