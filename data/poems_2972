MY SORROW
I opened up my arms,
To where you shall be held,
You turned away your face,
And that is why i have sorrow,
Sorrow seeps my viens,
Into those open arms,
They shut tight,
And that is why i have sorrow,
Tomorrow never comes,
My arms are never opened,
Beacuse they seek the day,
You will come back to me,
That is why i have sorrow.
