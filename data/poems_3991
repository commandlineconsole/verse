IF I REALLY CARED FOR YOU
I'm not that one to tell you,
Someone else you love...
Doesn't care.
I'm not that one to tell you,
Someone else you love...
Isn't there to care for you,
Like I do.
Because....
Who you see back then,
I never was.
This is the me,
You haven't seen.
I'm not that one to tell you,
Someone else you love...
Isn't there to care for you,
Like I do.
Because...
I was always hiding just to see,
If you...
Cared for me.
I'm not that one to tell you,
Someone else you love...
Doesn't care.
Because...
If I really cared for you,
You'd know it too!
And you wouldn't...
Be there!
