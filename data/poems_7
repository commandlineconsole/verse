BITTER BLOW OF LOVE
Love! you dealt a bitter blow –
You lay me cross the mortal plains,
Bedewed, bedimmed amongst a show
Of tearful clouds: eternal rains
To weep at my enduring foe
Of harsh reality – searing pains of
Destiny: dependable propensity
To fool myself repeatedly
That I could ever triumph over love!

Bitter blow
Bitter blow
Bitter blow
Bitter blow
Bitter blow
Bitter blow of love, oh love
