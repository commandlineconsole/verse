LET ME LOVE SOMEBODY
Why do I turn away
When someone shows they care
It's been a long time
Since I've
Had the love and care
Of someone being there
Let me love somebody
Let me show them how much I care
Don't leave me
In this loneliness and despair
Tears of my life fall
As I think of what could have been
Fears of my life
Hide away
Untill someone shows they care
Then my nightmare begins
I walk away
Am I so twisted and torn
That I should never have been born
What do I have to do
To heal this heart of stone
Let me love somebody
Let me show them how much I care
