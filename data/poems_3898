I LOVED
I love
I love the stars
I love the trees
I love the cars
I love the sweets
I like the air
I like the night
I like the nation
I like the angle
I cherish the ivory
I cherish the luck
I cherish the ocean
I cherish the vocal
I adore the evening
I adore the yes
I adore the overseas
I adore the urgent
I care for life
I care for pride
I care for her
I care for you
I love her
But none loves I
