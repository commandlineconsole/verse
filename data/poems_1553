THAT KID
Legs dragging in the air
Eyes blurring in the twilight
Senses numbing in the game
What is the beginning where is the end
Pain and Pleasure
Which is sensing these
We cry in pain;  we cry in joy
Tears in eyes, when pain in boils
Tears in eyes, when pleasure in groin
Space and time
Pleasure and pain
Joy Sticks playing the game
In the hands of that KID?
