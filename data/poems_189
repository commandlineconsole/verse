UNABLE TO COMPARE
I love you, I love you, I love you
i can say these words throughout my life
to the very moment that i die
and yet it still wont compare
to the love that i shared
with only you, my love
I love you, I love you, I love you
i say these words all the time
i say these words through rhyme
still you wont be able to comprehend
how much i love you through time and time again
i love you, my love
I love you, I love you, I love you
if i must i will die
saying these words for the last time
to prove to you
that my love was very true
i lived through my love of you
I love you, I love you, I love you
now im saying them in eternity
waiting for you to finally join me
to re-spend our lives and love together
to re-prove our love for one another
throught eternity my love for you is still here
I love you, I love you, I love you
i say these word so many times
i say them each day with or without rhyme
and still knowing that you dont know
theres no other way i can show
my love for you
