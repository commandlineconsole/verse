BURNING REGRET
Raging inside, but
Ready to die, but
Burning flames
Go out in shame.
Burn if no one cares enough
What if someone cares enough?
Burn if no one needs me
What if someone needs me?
Going to scream, but
It's not a dream, but
Shouting tears
Don't help to cheer.
Curse if no one cares enough
But someone cares enough
Curse if no one needs me
But someone needs me
Die of guilt, but
Simply wilt, but
Fading away
Just makes it grey.
Die if no one cares enough
Why do you care enough?
Die if no one needs my
Oh, why do you need me?
