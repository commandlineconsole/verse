GHOST.
It loitered around day and night,
For the peace he couldn't get,
For the salvation it couldn't get,
For the lifting to the heavens,
Looking around feeling jealous,
Of common peoples' lives
Which It did while living,
Sometimes getting a delight
Of scaring the ones in night,
Unseen it wandered,
Sometimes delighted
Since it need not work,
It's lifecycle montonous,
Wondering when it will be
Trasported from the earth,
But yet conversing with similiar
Ghosts who came by,
All almenting their plight,
Which none could understand,
As to why the lazy ghosts were sad.
