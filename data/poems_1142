DIWALI: FESTIVAL OF LIGHT
Festival of light
Beautiful sweet sight
Fills us with delight
Do you know it?
It's Dewali
A festival to celebrate the victory
Victory of good over evil
God over Devil
Let's celebrate Diwali
A festival so holy
With this pledge
We will fight evil
Throughout our age
And support good
So long as we are in the world
And we are man
We will do best what we can
Let's share love and delight
On this festival of light
Shashikant Nishant Sharma ‘Sahil'
