ENVY OF ME
envy of me
for im stronger than thee
living this life full of treason
harsh manner with out a reason
jealousy is what we sought
but cannot seek
it blinds us deep
closing our eyes shut
envy of me
for im stronger than thee
words cutting me deep
stinging, sinking into my skin
anger slowly seeps in
the taste of bitter tears
the choking of hated fear
envy of me
for im stronger than thee
heart beating
fists tightening
anger bursting
we seek what we sought
but cannot get
envy of me
you're blinded & binded to ever raging jealousy
