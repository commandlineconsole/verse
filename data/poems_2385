WHAT I AM
Rage fills my soul
Rage will destroy my life
What can I do to kill this part of  myself?
Rage overcomes the love for another
Rage will eat my will to live
What can save me from this?
Anger will kill my will to live
Anger is what drives me
What could end this?
Anger envelops my soul
Anger cannot be destroy from my black heart
What could erase this part of my exsistance?
Hate causes this world to cease
Hate will always be in my mind
What should my mind tell me to do?
Hate fills my heart
Hate is what I feel upon this Earth
What should become of this vessel?
