ASKANCE
Yet of life i do not speak,
Where there is sorrow there is peace
Agitation  builds up till the brim,
Yet the cup speaks of gratis
In a state of delirium, i feel replete yet cleansed of sorrow
In a reverie
I question why in the world concocted sensitivity prevail
Why did you not create Why the heart desires and feels unwanted and unfulfilled
Dreams unsettled are there still yet a calm do I feel
Wish this delirium stays forever and i do not wake up to the world of deed
Deeds are what sane humanity reckons reckons like a treasure precious.... than life
not asking for more
