~DANCE THE SPIRIT OF JOY~
Dance the spirit of joy as the seasons come and go quickly.  All that is in this moment is sure to be some thing so different the next.  Welcome it.
Dance the spirit of joy for there is never a time life should not be celebrated.  Give thanks.
Dance the spirit of joy as the season of youth comes and move out hastily waiting only in the mind of a fool.  Call forth Wisdom.
Dance the spirit of joy when you look back to see that your crawling was needed to strengthened you on your way to the top; but was never the bondage of your character.
Dance the spirit of joy and Fly.  Yes, take flight.
