FEAR WITHIN ME
The fear has rushed back into me.
The door has closed
and sealed my bravery.
What was once strong
Is now weak from fear.
Fear is stronger
Then thought possible.
A war is inside me,
Fighting to balance
The fear I feel.
My fear will try
And have a victory,
But I won't let it win.
I will overcome my fear
And my reward will  be victory.
