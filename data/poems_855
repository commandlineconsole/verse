A SONG DELIGHT
today he perform the dance and rudram in him
when he curb the maya it is the full in swing
when universe in dark he dances in graveyard
when the universe awaken he dance with her!
The joyous of the minutes and profound thoughts
and the limitless sky is the eyes of wisdom
the earth beneath is the stage to dance
the mantra of joy ever rejoiced!
ye, in joy take the flowers to ponder
ye, in joy make the oceans to raise
ye, in joy make the breeze to flow rhythm melodious
ye, in joy make the rays shine glitter!
Relentless dance the rudram, performed to curb maya
beneath his legs maya down in flake
flares of fire swallows the love of the impure
over my head a place for you and you run over the world
who ever wishes to drink!  the river you are
hate not the people and hate not yurself
let you dance in joy and my dance always relentless!
