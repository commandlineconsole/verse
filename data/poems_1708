IDIOSYNCRASY
Speculation is full of riddles.
Trading is full of problems.
Coveting a woman is full of risk.
Solving the riddles,
Overcoming the problems
And braving the risk
Are the sources of pleasure.
To invent riddles to solve,
To create problems to overcome,
And to assume risk to come through
Are manâ€™s idiosyncrasy-
To create difficulties
For the pleasure of solving them.
