Photo: Manifesto Of Post-conceptual Poetry @ November,2009 (1)  It is a happy and prosperous event to know that you are asked that what post-conceptual poet-writer is. (2)  Post-conceptual poetics is constructed by the concept'speculation as a lack of the real' to investigate and analyse the conceptual frame. (3)  Poetics is a machinery but it is not build up of Language, concept and physical realities.It is actually realises and known that 'I' is not the machine to run things and after-I consciousness contemplated and prone to realities seen and alternative realities realities unseen but realized and felt by aha moments of existential beings. (4)  It can have the ability to touch the beyond-perceived realities in human chemistry called a post-conceptual voyage. (5)  It cacept icon, relic, image, symbol and metaphor to describe the ontological and plural realms of the arts.So, post-conceptual poet can be traced as multi-dispciplinary artist or poet or poet-artist. (6)  Post-conceptual poet can talk abut identity issues and apart from it, he or she can tell about outside operational realities. (7)  Post-conceptual cultural identity is composed of e-culture/technological culture and Buddism's philosophy(I don't assume Buddhism as religion)  of 24-things circle of human existence-Pahtana in Pali text but post-conceptual poetics accept that God is dead(Nietcze) : the author is dead.It is not a religion-oriented poetics. (8)  Post-conceptual death is the knowledge of the allegory used in conmceptual poetics is just liberated from the obesession of technique called narrational identity.It is a reflective and reflexive making of new or restructural knowledge pattern-a contemplative and initiative uncreativity in the digital revolution age. (9)  Post-conceptual phenomenon is composed of 1)  senses 2)  received feeling from senses 3)  awareness on mental composition, decomposition and recomposition 5)  beyond-I existence of mental faculty 6)  geopsychological awareness 7)  continuum of reality as a charachteristics of materiality, physicality and mental faculty 8)  beyond -prejudice insight for appropriation life in poetics of contemporaneity in the contemporary crises of identity, home, uncreativity, making and technoloical identity of anti-establishment or flexibily of carnivalization of defamilization upon creative, uncreative and art-making world together with quotidian experiences.9)  humanity rather than humanism 10)  social values, intellectual values, ethical values and civic values 11)  feeding humanity components in the weak area of techno-fed writings 12)  fer-robotics attitude and for -humanity attitude as a map of post-conceptual voyage 13)  post-colonial concepts 14)  site-specific concepts 15)  fashion 16)  mysticism 17)  metaphysics 18)  ecological awareness 19)  political awareness upon moment-to-moment behaviours 20)  digital politica 21)  scientific innovation 22)  Third mind 23)  The fourth mind(I have self-discovered it and written about it)  24)  endisms 25)  trans-aesthetics 26)  trans-disciplinary practice 27)  hermeneutics 28)  phenomenon-noumenon-conceptualization discoursal projects 29)  spritualism-wisdom on contemporary society 30)  dia-logic realities 31)  anti-establishment or neo-establishment in versitility

Photo: Egg to Hen Poem At first hard cover Inside a fluidity of identity atomic alchemy Boxing ring can be the hard holder of disciplinary existence Break free, whether it is true or false to touch the sky of the true base of humanity no humiliated conceptualization process but the birth if the eye is the eye if not blindness of life can happen it is an adventure of life, go for it Shaping form and colours first, then conditioned concepts and innate concepts encounter life sound and voice, the smallest units of human language the hard holder asks the fluidity of the existing identity what is the purpose of your life? how would you end your life? Form is now clear and idea is evolving out of complexity Like a poem with possessing vehicle of predetermined destiny Nyein Way Submitted: Friday, September 19,2008 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Save this on Delicious
