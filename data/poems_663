UNION HAS BEGUN
As if guided by some rule
The hearts begin to pound
Feelings of dreams to be fulfilled
Drive the bodies together.
A touch
A kiss
A loving embrace
Tenderness and energy abound
Wonder and joy from the touch
Passion abounds from the kiss
No longer a dream of lust
Now more a tender lover
Bodies ablaze from within
Focus on what you need
Feel the emotion and the energy
As passion and ecstasy abound
Energy and excitement from the lovers embrace
Dreams fulfilled
Magical expressions grow
The union has begun.
