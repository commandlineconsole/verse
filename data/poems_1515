GIVE PLEASURE
Take pleasure in giving pleasure
Because it is a great treasure
That brings joy and fun to all
Even if its an act very small
For life is made of layers
So stick to wishes and prayers
And always do the right
To make for others things bright
And try to do the things
That brings the joy's spring
And do it all with pleasure
Because doing it is a treasure.
