TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
To whom it may concern, people think I’ve got it made
But I can’t stand to be alone, the lights begin to fade
To whom it may concern, my life is like a song
The music, melancholy and the lyrics, always wrong
To whom it may concern, the days pass by so slow
The wind is never blowing, and the candles never glow
To whom it may concern, my intentions are always mistook
And no one seems to spare me a smile, or passing look
To whom it may concern, the cup is never full
And happiness will never come unless I pay the toll
To whom it may concern, the love left long ago
And all I know about the world is how to be alone
To whom it may concern, my mind is always reeling
But people tend to look at me and think I have no feelings
But I would like to tell you, my pain’s quite real, it burns
And so I write this poem…to whom it may concern
