WHY EMPOWER IT WITH CONCERN?
When something isn't...
Why empower it with concern?
What lesson is there learned,
By choosing to discuss...
The 'what ifs'.
As if those 'what ifs' breathe and exist!
When something isn't...
Why empower it with concern?
What lesson is there learned,
By choosing to discuss...
The 'what ifs'.
As if those 'what ifs' breathe and exist!
And the next step we need to take...
Is to select someone qualified,
To monitor our decisions and babysit!
And that time spent doing this...
Has been wasted like devalued dollars,
We struggle to find ways to throw away...
Or burn.
With no regard and less concern.
And that is the headache we've lived to earn.
Too many are already confused in creating solutions.
All we need to do,
Is to commit ourselves to have nothing to do with it.
Already you look relieved!
