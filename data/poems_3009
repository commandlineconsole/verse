DROWING, NOT SMILING
Sorrow deepens as the waves
engulve the land.
I perch on thet forest floor and cry.
Water flows out of my view.
Birds deliberatly sit at the edge of my sorrow-
as dogs lick my sorrow away.
And i fly with the wind
like ghosts whom stare out
in the open sky.
Shortly the land beyond is covered
with tears of my soul.
I drowned in sorrow,
and soon the water evaporates
with the sun.
As i lie on my back
the unclouded eyes,
smiled joyously;
traces of sorrow were
to be found, on my soul-
yet i felt free, uplifted:
and i was not drowning-
but smiling.
