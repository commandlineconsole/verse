FRUSTRATION FOR JUSTICE
The days Iâ€™m passing is completely injustice
The fear for no mistake
The fear for we believed in truth
The fear for the merit holder
The fear for knowing justice
The fear for the past I touched as a truth
The fear for the justice human being
The fear for helping others with sacrificing
Then all days long I have done for justice is just fear! !
