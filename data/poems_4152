FEAR
Fear is dark hatred,
So dark no light can penetrate.
Fear is a smear of red,
So strong the smell of fate.
Fear is lighting,
The thunderous pounding.
Fear is someone fighting,
So violent and yet so astounding.
Fear is like a gust of wind,
So strong and so chilling.
Fear is like a fiend,
So agressive and so frightening.
Fear is like a disease,
So hazardous and so quickly spread.
Fear is like a please,
Welcoming the dead.
Fear is like someone,
I have been trying to plea.
Fear is within everyone,
For it is inside me.
-Sonny Wu
