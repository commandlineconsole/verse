~AS IF YOU CARE~
This is my first poem attempt..hope it wd get better!
As f you care...
..if im happy or in great despair
As if you care...
..if i still walk on my legs or on a wheelchair.
As if you care.
.if i am here or elsewhere..
As if you care
...if i still exist or could no longer bear..
Would you really care? !
I dont need an answer..
As I no longer care!
