PASSING
It has been said
that death is simply passing
from one room to another
without fear, pain or concern.
It has been said
that you are once again
with your loved ones
and meeting those you descended from.
It has been said
that the feeling of peace
and tranquility is something
only experienced this one time.
It has been said
that never again will you feel
pain and suffering or
sadness at all.
Without these earthly concerns
let us hope.
In time
We shall all seeâ€¦
