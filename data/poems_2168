WILL YOU PAINT ME BETTER LIES
Can you paint me better lies
A million times a million tries
A heart like mine it does desire
To know someone who's not a liar
For in the darkest night you see
My mind is quick to what thee be
So can you paint me better lies
I'm sure you can it's no surprise
First your this and then your that
You have more lives than a ferrel cat
You call me near and stay away
But I've grown wise to the games you play
So will you paint me better lies
Of course you will it's in your eyes
A fool would be too blind to see
Just what you daily reveal to me
To walk with you down life's long path
Is a journey wasted just do the math
I'll bet you paint me better lies
'Cause your black heart will heed no ties
At the pearly gates you'll one day stand
And you'll be judged like all of man
And I wonder if before his eyes
You'll try to paint some better lies
For one as cold and cruel as thee
The Devil will make fine company
So go ahead and paint your lies
Your fate should come as no surprise
