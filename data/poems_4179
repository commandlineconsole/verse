# A FEAR NOT -2  [SENRYU]
[from a poem by MAHAKAVI BHARATHIAR]
even in a world
where the whole is against you
just fear not...fear not
even in a life
where you are forced to take alms
just fear not...fear not
even if treated
like a dust in the ground
just fear not....fear not
[essagathullor yavarum aethithu nindra pothilum
aachamillai aachamillai aacham aenbathu ellayay

picchay vaangi vazhum vaalkai petru vitta pothilum
aacchamillai aachamillai aacham aenbathu ellayay
thuchammendrenni nammai thooru seida pothilum
aacchamillai aachamillai aacham aenbathillaiyay]
