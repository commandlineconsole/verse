THIS MORNING WAKES ME TO THE NEW LIGHT
This morning wakes me to the new light,
Birds chirping and singing in this new delight,
The sun shining and making all the dark corners bright,
Making all get up and get ready for the new fight,
Itâ€™s the dreams and goals that make me feel right,
Getting up and ready for this new flight,
Welcome to the morning where god gives you a new zeal,
Making you ready for this new appeal,
Leave your worries, thoughts and fears for this new light,
Let  the world feel the enigma of your new delight,
Wake the child inside you for this new wisdom,
Start the day with your way to your freedom.
