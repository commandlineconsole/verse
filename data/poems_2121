THE ONE
'more precious than a dimond ruby or pearl' by doc wilde
it took many years of searching for 'the one'
took many years of heartbreak, rejection and heartbreak
and still no one
till i met this guy he came by my side
he took me by the hand and to my surprise
swept me off my feet and took me by surprise
five short  months of this fine mess
and fifty more years shall come
only because he is simply 'the one'
more precious than a dimond
better than a pearl
sweeter than sugar on the tip of your tounge
a girls best friend a diamond.....? ? ?
no
a girls best friend is the one who makes her laugh
tucks her in at night and swears they loves her the most
