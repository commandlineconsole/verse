LOVE OF FAMILY
I was raised by
the love of my family,
the love that made me grow strong,
the love that made me glow in the dark,
'Her face shines so bright
it doesn't have a sad mark'
that kind of love.
The love that has formed my life,
the love that made me survive,
'She's got the future' people say,
that kind of love.
I was raised by
the love of my family,
the love that taught me do good,
'Stay good and be the loved one'
that kind of love.
The love that is patient,
the love that is kind,
'She helps and doesn't mind'
that kind of love.
I was raised by
the love of my family,
the love that has taught me to live,
the love that does not back away,
'She has nothing bad to say'
that kind of love.
The love that is faithful,
the love that has nothing to fear,
'she doesn't give up'
that kind of love.
I was raised by
the love of my family.
