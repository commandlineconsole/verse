H(ANNA) H AKHMATOVA
You surprised me – and I am not easily surprised.
You amazed me – though I am not easily amazed.
You brought to me the song of your spirit
On the very day you gave it voice.
Duschinka, Daughter,
In all my years
No such sound has reached my ears,
Soft and gentle as Nat ‘King’ Cole
Yet possessed of the power of Rock ‘n’ Roll.
You’re a balladeer: a Sting, a Jackson Browne –
Your ‘Message in a Bottle’ profound.
You set it free so all could see...
Yet, you gave it first to me.
