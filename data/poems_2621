MR.SADNESS
mr.sadness took from my heart a place to grow
and any hope knock at my heart door he orders it to go
he makes my tears fall to quench his thirst
and he feel so proud cu`z when I describe my life
I mention him first.
please come back
and take away the sadness that you caused
and open the happiness doors which you closed
make Mr.sadness get out from my heart
cu`z  the day when he will  go
my life will start
