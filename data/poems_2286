ANGER
Your voice is too loud
Always try to be calm
Try to work things out
Without fight or qualm
Always tame your anger
You're not an animal
Whose anger is danger
And end up so abysmal
Anger in the morning
Isn't a good sign of the day
Anger in the evening
Will ruin good sleep, I say
Anger will sour the blood
Squeezing its happy flow
Wash away peace like flood
The head; so sick and low!
To be angry isn't a crime
But the result is impious
Losing God's blessing all the time
And end up gladless, yet vicious
Maintain your good health
Your anger mustn's drive you
Self control is part of wealth,
Despite what ever you pass true
