JOY
the feeling you get when your day is alright
the feeling you get when your heart is in the perfect place
the feeling you get when your glowing inside and out
that feeling you get is
Joy
that way your face curls end to end
that way your body can't stand still
that way your warm and happy with who you are
that way you are is
Joy
the way your mind races
as if you opened up chocolate cases
you feel like your lifted from a maze
just from one little gaze
it's
Joy
