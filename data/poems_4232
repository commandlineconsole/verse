DON'T FEAR THE STALKER
Real estate has come
Here but now they're gone
Jason doesn't fear the reaper
Nor do Eli, Alex or Taylor
We should be like they are
Come on baby...Don't fear the stalker
Baby take my camera...Don't fear the stalker
We'll be able to walk...Don't fear the stalker
Baby I have your camera
The cake is done
flies came and ate it but now their gone
Jay and Brett
Are together in eternity
Jason's coming every day...watching Jay and Brett
Eli's coming everyday... rebake the cake
Taylor's coming everyday...to watch TLC
Come on baby...Don't fear the stalker
Baby take my camera...Don't fear the stalker
Watching you everywhere...Don't fear the stalker
Watching you forever
The police had come
Here but now they're gone
Came last night of therapy
And it was clear she couldn't walk
The door was open and the cat appeared
The camera flashed and then disappeared
The curtain blew and he appeared
Saying don't be afraid
Come on baby...then she got off the wheelchair
And then she tripped and fell on him
Then they started to walk out the door
They went forward and said good bye
She had become like they are
She had taken his camera
Then took a picture of them
She had melted his heart of ice
She had taken the cake
She had become like they are
Come on baby...Don't fear the stalker
...Don't fear the stalker
