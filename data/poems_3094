SUFFERINGS AND JOYS OF LIFE!
All the sufferings of romantic hero finally lead to joy!
Sufferings of good men have to end only in happiness;
All enjoyments of arrogant fellows have to end in sorrow!
Sorrows of comedians are generally groundless ever;
Pleasures of villains at the cost of others end in pain!
Sorrows and joys are two sides of a coin for good or bad;
If the beginning is joyful then end will be full of sorrow
And if the beginning is full of grief the end will be joy!
Fruits of labour are produced by painful works of others
Nobody can ignore but cherish and do better in works,
A gratitude no one can fail to show in life to be civilised!
Enjoying pleasures at the painful cost of others no human
Will willingly perform anytime but only a savage creature
Without any merciful heart does if there is rhyme or reason!
