IFâ€“REVISITED AGAIN
My sorrow is unstopped
Not even God can heal me,
For 'tis His grief as well.
Hope flickers and dies
As his time grows short on earth
And the day of departure comes near
And he slips away into
Eternal darkness.
My sorrow hardens, shapes resolve:
A will that comes from God and grows
My life and purpose here are found:
To show the world its only Hope
The Love who died to bring us Life.
