YOU BRING ME JOY
You bring me joy
I live not in search of constant happiness
I believe you belong with me
It is the most precious wish!
Seriously you belong with me
Did I tell you, you bring me joy
Gushing joy to explore eternity
It does not matter who found what first
Of what money cannot buy or hard cash cannot quiver
You belong with me
