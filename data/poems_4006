CARE
They do not care,
Though they may say that they do.
They pity-
It is weaker, temporal,
Emotion.
Care is deeper,
Truer.
A kind of love, brought on against the will,
And yet overpowering,
Consuming.
They do not care-
They do not understand care.
Care is self-denial,
Which they will not do:
They are incapable of self-denial,
For they are driven by their own sense of self-importance,
And this they cannot deny themselves.
They will never care.
