PERHAPS THE ANSWER
Perhaps the answer
to the question
of fearing
not fearing
is to question
its validity
and more so
its necessity
and even its protection
but I do
and I don’t
know
the answers
only (I think)  – or at least, mainly
because I don’t know
the minds
of past and potential
intruders
so I question
the questions
and I continue
to fear
not fearing.
Perhaps the answer
is to find another question
or perhaps the answer
is to fear
fearing.
