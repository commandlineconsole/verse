THROUGH INFANT'S EYES

Sights seen through infant’s eyes
Every sight a new surprise
Eyes gaping wide, eyebrows rise
Mouth an ‘O’…Surprise! Surprise!
Each day filled with new delights
Both small and large in size
All days new from dawn to night
With sights seen new
Through infant’s eyes
Motes of dust…
Be they Angel’s wings?
All things wondrous!
Wondrous things!
Sights seen
…through Infant’s eyes…
