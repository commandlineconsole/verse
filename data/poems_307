I LOVE A WOMAN
I love a woman with all of me
I love a woman in great depth
I love a woman and her name is Mystique
I call her that for she ventured deep into my heart
And found hidden away a man fresh of wounds
A good but hurt man
A man sensible and caring
A man full of affection
She found a manâ€¦
And I love a woman
i love her for who she is
I love her without knowing how
But i love and loved her from the first day i saw her
I loved her and love her for what i see in her
I love and loved her for how she makes me feel
I love and loved her for the happy moments she brought into my life
I love and loved her for she believed in me
I love a woman
One in particular
I love a woman
Her name is Mystique
I love a woman just for loving her
She loves me too
And I love her more: -*
I love this woman
