WAITING FOR SORROW`S REPLY
Time invited sorrow........
Oh! no one in the world welcomes you
You dissolve them slowly and muddle them
make them anxious and put them noxious!
You shake the souls and the shadows
freightened them!
dubious thoughts crop up in mind
behind the scene they feel painful sorrow
which they did not invite in them!
Oh! all the feelings dissolve in you
the minutes that count
mount the sorrow  where is the joy
the dark in you swallows the light
Oh! time have you  invited sorrow in me
dissolves me crumbles me a heap
fear engulf in me and
waiting for sorrow`s reply
when did you go
by the passage of time give me joy and
shine let the rays of hope sprout in me! !
Let the time invite joy and shine......
