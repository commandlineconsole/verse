LIFE
As we grow
We change our mold
When life comes our way
Nothing can be expected
It brings joy
It brings sorrow
It brings pain
And relief
Life is our greatest gift
And worst curse
It brings as much melancholy
As it does joy
When times get rough
We lower our heads
When things get dark
We brighten our hearts
Life is a curious thing
It brings as much melancholy
As it does joy
Life is a mysterious thing
And no matter how hard we search
We can never discover its truth
