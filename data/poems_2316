THE TRUTH
They say that they can take it
They say they want to know
And for a second I believe it
And then they start to show
All the anger that's inside
All the anger that they know.
I knew that it was in there,
Somewhere peeking out
But how could I know,
What was coming next.
All the anger, and the hatred
all the hurt thats in thier eyes
It's what I had expected but not at all what i had wished.
