FEAR'S THE KEY!
In constant fear, the modern world lives in!
Uncertainty afills the hearts of men;
What kind of future awaits, no one knows;
Fear is the key to overdoing things!
The fear of rights being denied is one;
The fear of injustice and unfairness;
The fear of enslavement by ones near/far;
Fear of lack of chances to come up in life!
The threat of being pushed down life's ladder;
The fear of being unloved everywhere;
The fear of staying outdated and poor;
The fear of not catching up with the world!
The fear of stifled conscience is real;
The fear of authoritarianism;
The fear of over-taxation, price-rise;
The fear of ill-health due to pollution!
The fear of invasion by neighbor states;
The fear of destruction of life and wealth;
The fear of incarceration in jails;
The fear of worshipping an alien God!
Fears of every kind engulf hearts and minds!
There is no peace in homes, 'midst fellowmen;
Fear is the key to numerous problems;
Shed fears unreal, real so galore.
None can progress if fears deny your sleep;
Bitterness, anger, revenge then come in;
Suspicion rules the roost in things you do;
Discontent gains the upper-hand each day!
Let undue fears not impediments turn;
Let confidence of self and cheer fill minds;
Let virtual threats not waste your time and wealth;
Live for the present cheerfully with God!
