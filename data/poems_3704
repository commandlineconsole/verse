TAKE CARE
Take care of yourself first
Take care of your health
And have a good night sleep
Take care of the garden
Water the garden once a while so the flowers can grow
Take care of the land
Pick up all the litter flying around
Because it looks messy
Take care of the oceans
By cleaning all of the oil spills
If not we will kill all the fishes
Take care of the fire place
It needs wood to keep the fire going
Take care of the wild life
We need to save than
