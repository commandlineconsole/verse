UNPLESANT TOO
It is not me who first came there
I sat as the first settler
Then it all comes
I found my attentions elsewhere
For I cannot concern to my aside
She just kept leaning back
While I prefer a distance for space
I'm old enough to take all these
But she's a young one who cannot stand the tedious
I proclaim I was not interested at all
for the leanings and the high heels no worse than mine
Instead I'd rather prefer looking away through the window
for the withered dead branch
Oh, how can I shift my attention to the class
