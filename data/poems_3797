IF ANYONE CARED
Even though people say they care
most of the time they don't
Then, when someone asks you
why you think no one cares
you say
Because if anyone cared
they wouldn't have bullied me
from kindergarten until past eighth grade
If anyone cared
someone would've asked why I was crying
any time I was curled up in a heap in a corner
If anyone cared
someone would've sat with me at the lunch table
or at least said hi to me as I walked down the hall
people who care don't just ask what's wrong
then ignore your answer
and pretend they heard you
People who care
listen to you and comfort you
They help you through the rough patches
sometimes I'll find someone who I think truly cares
but I almost always get proven wrong
It's so hard for me to trust people
and people wonder why
I just tell them to think real hard
after all...they were the ones who did this to me
