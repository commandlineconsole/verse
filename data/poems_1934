2005 / 06 / 10 - MY NEWLY DISCOVERED RELATIVE
I thought she'd be insensitive
Haughty, arrogant and sarcastic
Maybe like Cruella from the 101 Dalmatians
Or the evil witch in Snow White,
But I was surprised to find out
She was cute, harmless and funny
A bit shy at first, but then opened up,
Very imaginative and very gifted.
But I was even more surprised to see
I had found a new friend
In my newly discovered relative!
