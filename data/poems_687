LINGERING KISSES
A lingering kiss remains on my lips
I can feel your warm skin below
Entangled in our passion
Pure
Raw
Undeniable
Sparkling eyes stare off into the the distance
Hands tremble, voices break
the soft Moonlight kisses every curve of your body
Groping hands explore every part of an unknown world
Taboo
A fire ablaze in our kiss
A mad passion
eyes open and the hunger quells
Breathe in
Breathe out
A lingering kiss remains on my lips
