MY LEMON TEARS
Sarrow and sadness taste like lemons,
So when i cry myself to sleep every night my tears are lemon,
I cry and cry,
Cant stop thinking of my grandpa,
I prayed and prayed,
But god still took his soul,
The sadness grows,
I never knew him,
seperated by space,
Never to know him makes me cry,
To hear his song on my ipod,
The lemon tears of sarrow roll in faster and faster,
