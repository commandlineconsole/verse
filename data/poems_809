LETTER TO DEBBY
Am not afraid to let u go
I just don't want u 2 go
I love u, please don't go
If u must leave, then lets go
In you, i have found joy
Please, don't go away with this joy
i beg u, don't kill dis joy
This new found Joy
Take my hand
your name is boldly written in my hand
Don't let go of this hand
You ll only find comfort in dis hand
The foe leo does not deserve you
U need me, I need you
I need to be there for you
I love you.
