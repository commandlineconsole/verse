HAPPINESS
Is happiness a tame form of pleasure?
Contendedness- barren plains.
Pleasure thrills, happiness dulls.
Pleasure in excess- destructive,
Contentedness to excess- Spartan.
Pleasure- tasting sweet excitement.
The appetite juices,
For dangerous desires,
They gnaw and nibble.
But instead of bungying from the roof-
I stick stamps on postcards.
