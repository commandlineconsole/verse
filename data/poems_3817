MIRROR
Caring loss cares not to care for lossless care. Irrelevant means to justify the deeds of loneliness and transcendent dreams. Have not care or strife towards the empty innocent night or you will stand and stare into the eyes of the demon dark devil mare. There you will find a mirror in time reflective as the great cycle repeats. Be scared of that moment for you will find your soul has wilted and retreats into the recesses of the mind, enveloped by time, and left wandering doomed to repeat.
Repeat doomed wandering mind. Wilted surrender afraid and left behind. Spiraling upwards you move back into the light, the night foul horse falls victim to your plight. Troubles past move beyond at last. Apathy now evolves, replacing the calls for jubilant dreams and compassionate needs. Care not for your loss, for now you have become what once cared to have lost.
