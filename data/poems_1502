AH, THE PLEASURE
Ah, the pleasure to sleep with your lover,
to feel body warmth,
soft gently breath of contented sleep,
comfort in a space shared,
an arm gently over your body,
a movement in sleep which leads to a cuddle or embrace,
perhaps even a sleepy kiss and to sleep again with your lover,
to know so much pleasure in time not concious to the woken mind,
to touch and feel safe,
to gently waken after sleeping with your lover,
Ah, the pleasure to sleep with your lover..............
This was my thoughts after a shared wonderful weekend with my lover.
