- THOUGHTS FOR SALE: : HUMOUR, INSPIRATION
If you go to the shop and say
I'd like to procure some thoughts for today
And the shopkeeper says we have thoughts on sale
That will make you weep and make you wail
Leave those thoughts sitting on the shelf
And buy some other ones for yourself
Thoughts that may concern simple pleasures
Are beyond a priceless measure
There are countless thoughts in this shop for sale
So why pick the ones that make you weep and wail?
Rummage through those until you will always find
Thoughts that are of the uplifting kind
(Sydney, Australia - 2005)
