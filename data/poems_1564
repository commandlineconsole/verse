EXPLORE
explore
all the paths
find the meaning
of each labyrinth
there are shades
of light
from the prism
of our existences
life, death
rebirth
we do not die
all at once
do not deny
pleasure
welcome the pain
and be
freed from the prison
of the tentacles
of dread
and joy
live now and be too kind
for the truths
of love and hate
lust and pleasure
there is not a single
path reserved
for those who really
love every moment
dripping dropping
water and dew
on leaves
rivers rushing
to the sea and rain
always falling
for more
pleasure to the
earth
always there are openings
find them
always there are pleasures
try them
explore this world
of desire
for this is the gateway
to the holiness
of our soul
