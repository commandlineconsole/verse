WRATH
The anger that controls
A body hardened
By unvealed anger
That can devour the soul
Hidden with in, crying out
To be freed
From this berserk state
Where the soul is in no control
And has been replaced by something else
So with its driving force
The body fights bloody wars
And the mind tries
To push off the insanity
