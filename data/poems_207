LOVE, REALLY
Love is always
wondering if
Love has given
you the syph
Love is patient
Love runs free
Love slept with his
secretary
Love is bang
Love is pow
Love is watching
him play WoW.
Love is cunning
like a cat
Love walked out
When I got fat
Love connects us
like a belt buckle
Love is dancing
the five-knuckle shuffle.
Love is exotic
like a night in Peru
or sitting on the couch
watching SVU
Love is stupid
Love is dumb
No seriously,
love is really stupid and dumb.
