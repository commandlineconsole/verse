DISTRESS
The fear of awakening in then night,
to a loud bang and not being able to
find your glasses.
The fear of looking down a 5 story building,
thinking what if the glass just disappeared.
The fear of losing control of your vehicle,
not being able to regain traction.
The fear of becoming impaired,
yet you can only think.
Yet the fear of losing you,
is so much greater.
