PASSION
Passion....a need within...without it we feel cold
Passion....the burning.....the yearning....it is always something we reach for
when we have it, .we don't ever want it to go away
but it is something we need to nourish every day
Passion....Romance is it's food
A gentle touch....a generous heart....a sweet gesture.
....it is those little things that mean a lot to her
Passion....comes with romance...which is something that we forgot!
it is something we all want
nourished by the soul...fantasized in our dreams
whether we are young or old....desires never stops it seems
Passion....we all need it!
