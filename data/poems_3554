THE NOTE
FRANKIE HAS RETURNED
TO THE SCENE

TO WHOEVER IT CONCERNS

HERE I SIT WITH GUN IN HAND
IT WON'T BELONG  BEFORE
IT COMES TO AN END

ONE FINAL NOTE, JUST ONE WRITE
THAT'S ALL I NEED, TO EXPLAIN WHY?
AND THEN TO SAY GOOD-BYE

IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I CRY
NO ONE IS NEAR AND LISTENING
THEY CAN'T SEE THE GUN GLISTENING

RUSSIAN ROULETTE IS THE NAME OF
THE GAME I'M PLAYING, MISSED THE BULLET
4 TIMES ALREADY, HOW MANY MORE, I WON'T EVEN GUESS
MAYBE THE NEXT ROUND WILL BE MY LAST SO
I STOPPED LONG ENOUGH TO TELL YOU THIS

MY HEART WILL NEVER MEND
SO I WILL BRING IT TO AN END
I SIMPLY HAVE NO CHOICE
I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS

THIS IS HOW IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE
I WILL CONTROL MY OWN DESTINY
I WON'T LIVE A LONELY LIFE
JUST BECAUSE SHE IS NOT MY WIFE

TO DIE BY MY OWN HAND
SUICIDE, OH HOW GRAND
ETERNITY
HEAVEN OR HELL
HOW CAN YOU TELL

LIVING WITHOUT HER
IS LIKE LIVING IN HELL

SO HERE I SAY GOOD-BYE
I RAISE THE GUN AND PULL
THE TRIGG..... BOOM! ! ! !
