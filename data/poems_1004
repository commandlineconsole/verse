A PART OF TOMORROW
Find a way to taste
At least a part of tomorrow
For life is full of dear
Joy and also sorrow
So try to find another
way to finish the day
And try to bring in it
Joy and fain ray
And know that it is good
And you must always share
Good things in your life
With those who are near and dear
And you must try very hard
To taste and find a way
To add some more joy
To each of your day.
