MOTHER IS THE SUPERNATURAL!
To a child's ear, 'mother' is the supernatural in any speech
Mother is the name of God in the lips and hearts of children
A mother is she who can achieve the place of all others.
Mother is the bank where we deposit all our sorrowfulness and uncertainties.
A mother's love is a gift of life, unconditional, and everlastingly
No manipulate is as powerful as that of the mother
The power of motherhood is greater than natural decree.
My mother's love for me was so infinite I have worked stiff to justify it.
Mother who ran to assist me when I fell, or kissed the place to make it well?
God could not be everywhere and therefore He made mothers.
Motherâ€™s adore is the fuel that enables a normal human being to do the impossible.
Of all the constitutional rights of women, the greatest is to be a mother
She transport the sunshine into the house; it is currently a enjoyment to be there
When it comes to love, Mom's the word.
For all the ways you've assist me grow up
I would like to say I love you so
