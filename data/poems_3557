CALL HIM A ROOMMATE
a  room mate who can find
brother is he
a soul that concerns
eager to help
a friend indeed
detects a need
ready to meet
a companion he names
sees a sad face
lovingly consols
calls he loyal partner
sense an empty tummy
sets rice on fire
a well wisher alert
notices a persistent flaw
quick to correct
a conscientious adviser
examines a matter
scriptures therein recommends
i can boldly say
mine is he, a room mate
