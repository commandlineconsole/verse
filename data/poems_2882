THE END IS NEAR
I´m getting closer to the end
For every step I take
I don´t rush there
Nor do I turn back

All I see is gray
But my memories are colorful
Like being apathetic
I feel no extremes
I hardly feel at all

Some sadness I have
But it isn´t meant to be for me
And not for what´s coming

It´s a sadness from within
When I understand
I won´t have what I once had
When I finally get that what I want
I won´t get a fraction of
