ANGER
Anger, slowly gathering.
Black cumulonimbus of emotion,
Piling anvil heads on the horizon,
Ever rumbling threats of a great storm;
Unresolved.
Anger, frozen as Anarctica,
Metrically ticking off each milligram of insult,
Stabbing with icicle sharpness at vulnerability,
Academically observing the squirming victim;
Untouched.
Anger, sudden eruption of a petrol bomb.
Splashing agony and pain in all directions.
The start of an all consuming conflagration,
Whole worlds will be destroyed;
Unextinguishable.
Anger; a snake writhes and twists,
Trying to shed its unwanted akin,
Ever turning back on itself, masochistically
Tearing itself apart;
Unending,
Anger, under pressure,
Constantly leaking out, wearing away,
Nagging, denegrating, alkali acids
Fossilising the self that was,
Unrevealed.
Anger. Unresolved, untouched,
Unextinguishable, unending, unrevealed.
Glossed over with smile and nod,
Varnished into a straight - jacket,
Harnessed to a lifetime's
Work of hate.
