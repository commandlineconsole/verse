MY DAILY DELIGHT.
Indulging in opulent foam
I sigh and move, indolent,
Into a paradise, floating
In warm silkiest, fragrance
Of liquid delight. Immersing
I wonder what betters this,
And whisper my pleasure, yet know,
As I now hide in this bath
Of comfort, another lake waits.
I then glide through a dream to
A  distant watery haven
Where I know I will go,  feel
Such fluid welcome, be covered
With love, more bouyantly warm
Than this substitute joy. Water
Delights me, but bliss is with you.
