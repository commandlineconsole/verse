SADNESS WALKS UPRIGHT
Sadness walks upright.
She is heated,
flushed with the searing fire
of emotional pain.
She is a paradox.
She can laugh and play
even as her heart
turns to ashes inside her breast.
When in company
Sadness will skip and make merry.
But when she is alone,
when the blood flows down her slender arm,
Sadness aches with loneliness.
For though she bears her soul
in masked verse and dismal jests
no one sees her true nature.
Sadness is alone.
