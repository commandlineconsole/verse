THE BLACK MASK OF SADNESS
I visited the Museum today
To see the exhibits of clay
There I found a mask of sadness
And as I stared into the blackness
It began to say:
'This Life is so meaningless
So far from serene bliss
I wonder about my life lost
Afraid of what my death would cost
Buy why am I here
When death is so very near
With all the pain in my head
I just wish I was dead'
I left the museum that day
Not knowing what to say
My vision touched me so deep
That the sadness, I was forced to keep
For that night after sunset
The mask and my face met
And then I was aware
That the mask had always been there
