PASSION GATHERS NO DUST
Mistress of passion,
Steal thy eye.
Fluid with flesh,
Bodies to mesh.
Passion gathers no dust.
Harness thy pain,
Oblivion of Love.
Oblivion of Lust,
Stoke thus my flame.
Passion gathers no dust.
Mine be Thy love,
Thine love my pleasure.
Breast to brow, toe to toe,
Fire Thy flame forever.
Passion gathers no dust.
Should the Raven pick ripe fruit,
Love bears no wrong.
Alluring power whisper the hour,
Loving through eternity's song.
Where passion gathers no dust.
