BECAUSE OF HUMILITY AND LOVE
Because of humility and love
My voice choked
Hear me, I am speaking in
Faltering language.
My nature is expansion
As I am in love
I want to spread love
Throughout the world.
I know this world is here
Only for love
The sun the moon the stars
All are here for love
The air is here
The rain water is here
The birds the flowers
The animals and all the creatures
Are here only for love.
Nothing but love reign the world
That I know my dear
Only through love
Perfection can be achieved.
Love love love love
Love love love love
See my voice choked in love
And in life it is only love.
Love is a wonderful structure
Love increases in the course of time
Love is here to give life
Love me love me love love me.
