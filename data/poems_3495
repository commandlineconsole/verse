THE SLEEP BETWEEN DAYS
The intercourse of the nights and days
Mollify my insightful nature of the mind,
Minds concern me as they do with the body.
For each mind solves the creation
Inwardly vilifying and maligning us.
Let sleep be for thirty days, and we weep,
Seeing a corpse in the way of our path
And crying today and tomorrow.
Our minds erase the splendid priests
Who pray and listen to us and our
Confessions on the eve of our deaths.
The interior of the heart is full of intercourse
And facts have exchanged between pupils
Who concern the teaching minority.
The professors hand feed the handsome learners,
Beautiful in the extreme, like soldiers that stick
With their legs and arms after the bombardment in life.
