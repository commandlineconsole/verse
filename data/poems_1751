WANDERING MIND.
The mind wanders many a time,
Without permission,
Of my self obsessions,
Bringing in a pleasure
Not noticed, a cool breeze
Of thought passing by,
Thinking of mundane things,
Like a dame which passes by,
Of a dude walkimg away,
Of a speeding bus, or car,
Leaving my worries
Of the material pleasures
I lost to make, or is to make,
The pangs of someone's
Unwanted, unliked remarks,
Hurting my mind many a time,
the wandering mind,
Stopped more often than not,
By selfish likings, dislikes
Why does this happen,
And why don't I let
The mind wander in peace
To bring in serene peace without cost?
