WALK WITH ME [VILLANELLE]
Morning blessed me today
For you with me took stride
As you walked my sorrows away
The skies might have been gray
But with you by my side
Morning blessed me today
Let no one ever curse this day
For heaven descended like tide
As you walked my sorrows away
I knelt down to for us pray
Yet I shelved our love aside
Morning blessed me today
I know I did not my vow lay
Since I stood by you beside
As you walked my sorrows away
In this love we have our way
But in a way perceptively wide
Morning blessed me today
As you walked my sorrows away
