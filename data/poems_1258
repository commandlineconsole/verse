ASTERS SO BEAUTIFUL
Some say you rival not
The lark and woodland thrush.
The sky above is their lot
High above the woods and brush --
You hug the earth and bless it with your purple blush.
What delights the eye
Can delight the ear,
See the songs of the sky
Melodies most dear,
But hear the beauty of the earth in the colors of the year.
