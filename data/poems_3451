MAITRI BHAVANA OF BUDDHISM
To realize others' concern as ours
And come forward to help them in their sour
Is the essence of Maitri Bhavana,
A philosophy Buddhism has given.
Neglects fetch neglects; sucours fetch sucours.
Everyone knows it and yet ignores it.
Ensuring own needs and ignoring others,
One enjoys life and ignores rainy days.
Maitri Bhavana practiced, one gets
Equanimity, a non-judgmental
Attitude in a given situation,
Which'll block the tendencies for selfishness.
Probe the person you have got hatred for.
Probe the people you are in conflict with.
You may find why they are so to you
And a way will be born for a patch up.
Without concern for others, one cannot live.
With a deaf ear to others, one can't buy peace.
Mutual helps are a panacea to the stress.
