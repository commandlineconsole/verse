LOVE SURPRISE
I shouldn't be surprise when you will hate me tomorrow
I cant believe I just let you go away
And now I will be some how chasing you
there is nothing I could do ells hoping and wishing.
My only memory when u are not around of me is singing your name.
I know that we are surprise cause there is gap between us.
but at the end i know we are going to find that sine of our love
some may call it love surprise,
but I will call it my true love
if i could see the future before being in love
I know it will looked like how it it looked before.
but after going throw all the sorrow
am sure its not love surprise.
