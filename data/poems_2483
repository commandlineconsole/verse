LIFE STORY
The flower wilts,
The grass sways,
Life is bare and cold.
The wind howls,
The thunder roars,
Love is unpredictable.
The thunder howls,
The lightning strikes,
Anger is sudden and strong.
The bird chirps,
The mouse squeaks,
Harbingers of spring.
Life is cold,
Love is unpredictable,
Anger is strong,
I look forward to spring.
