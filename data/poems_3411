DEAR FRANK O'HARA
Dear Frank,
thank you for your concern.
i have recovered quite nicely
from my fall.
i just can't seem to sleep so i
spend my nights counting
the cracks in the wall.
listening to the cars go by
and wondering...
i remember
when i was young
i met a beautiful mexican girl
near the ocean
her hair was as dark
as a raven's love.
i wonder whatever became of her
she had the smile of a waning moon.
be careful  walking at night on the beaches
.
again
thanks for your
concern,
Lana T
thanks for your
concern.
