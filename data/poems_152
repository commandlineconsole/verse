SIMPLY LOVE
There’s only one thing in this life I need
And only one girl who can give it to me
Give me love, your love
Love, all your love
Love, your love
Simply love, all your love
No it’s not headline news
But without it, I’ve been so lost and confused
Give me love, your love
Love, all your love
I want to shout it, but they already know
It’s on my face everywhere I go
Give me love, your love
Love, all your love
No it’s not headline news
But without it, I’m so lost and confused
Give me love, your love
Love, all your love
You’re everything in life I need
Everything else is just old fashioned greed
Give me love, your love
Love, all your love
Love, your love
Simply love, all your love
