GIVE JOY
Life is for a day or two
So try in it to sincerely view
And collect things for you to enjoy
Like finding comfort in giving joy
For when you give out some love
It comes back as a gift of above
And also carries in it some care
That's a constant source of cheer
And when you give care to all
Then it breaks the trouble's wall
And you start feeling good 'n nice
And you feel its joy dear twice
So always remember and keep in mind
That when you want something to find
Then find comfort in giving joy
For its a constant source to enjoy.
