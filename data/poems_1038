THE WORLD ORDER
Darkness first then light.
Despair, then Hope
War, then Peace
Evil, then Redemption
When sorrow passes,
be assured joy follows suit
When war breaks,
wait, peace will soon  flow
Tears flow, then joy breaks
when it rains, the sun shines
to dry away the tears
the tears, the rain
all captured by the sun, the joy
The world order
that the world breaks
and God mends
the world despair, God hopes
the world kills, God heals.
and this is the world order.
