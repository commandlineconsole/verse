THERE IS NO FEAR
The people of this world, if against they stand,
There is no fear, there is no fear, nothing like fear.
Although, we are counted cheap and rebuked,
There is no fear , there is no fear , nothing like fear.
If to beg for food, would be a life attained,
There is no fear , there is no fear , nothing like fear.
Loveable possessions if, are lost,
There is no fear , there is no fear , nothing like fear.
2. If clothed bosomed damsels, cast their eyes
There is no fear , there is no fear , nothing like fear.
Poison in the mouth, if fed by friends
There is no fear , there is no fear , nothing like fear.
Shielded armies, if to attack approach
There is no fear , there is no fear , nothing like fear.
On the acme of my head, if the sky did crash and plummet down
There is no fear , there is no fear , nothing like fear.
