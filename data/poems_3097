FINDING MYSELF
As i walked through my garden of sorrow i came across a man he was someone of interest he knew more about myself than me He wanted to help me through my pain and sorrow I talked to him and he listened with interest he was there to guide me through my pain and sorrow He guided me down the path of my sorrows He helped me and guided me  through my lifes troubles i told him there is too much to say so much to hear too far to walk theres too much everything except time He told me time changes people and society influences others just be yourself and change for the better be a friend be a mother but stay constant and dont be influenced by others When i saw the depth of his beauty i saw the shallowness inside me with the guidance of this man i conquered all paths and hurdles i entered that garden alone and confused i left and left realizing i was not alone I learned if you reach out your hand there will be someone to hold it never give up never walk away know that your loved and we are not here to stay
