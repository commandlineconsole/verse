SWEET LIPS
door to passion
a svelte pink lace
fine lined sensuous haven
sensitive as a mollusk
shy like an Oriental country belle
warm as a newborn babe
craving for mummy's swollen breast
door to passion,
hottest Assamese chillies
sting, set to fire a woman's heart
like equinox Sun
tempest in the calm of space
only eyes would give away
lips to experience its tremour
door to passion
a black woman's
thick erotic pouty loads
deceptive as chameleon
manoevre through them
and you see ivory white
towers bordering an
orifice of ecstatic  desires
