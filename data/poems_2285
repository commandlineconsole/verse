WHEN I SEE YOU
When i see you
Out of Control
And all I can see is the lostness of soul.
Don't know if I'm coming
Don't know if I go
Don't know if the answer
I don't know, I don't know.
Grasping and reaching but
Nothing is there
And all I can see is the smell in the air.
The anger is coming
The anger is here
The anger is knowing
It's all that I fear.
It's coming from me
But I blame it on you
It's making me blind
I don't know what to do.
It's burning me down
It eats me alive
It's hurting me now
I'll never survive.
The anger is real
But I make it a lie
The anger I feel
Is the anger I hide.
I hate u as much as i love you
