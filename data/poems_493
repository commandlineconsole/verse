SLOWLY FORGOTEN
Sink away the memory
sink away love
drown out passion
drown out patience
burn down the tower of lies
Slowly you slip from me
my patience for you has gone
I no longer think of you all the time
even your voice is a fleeting memory
how long
has the passion been gone?
soon I'll burn it down passion, lies and all to the ground
