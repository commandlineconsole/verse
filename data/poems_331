LOVE CAN BE
Love is love can be,
What you've never had before
Love is love can be,
Everlasting joy
Love is love can be,
The one to make you soar
Love is love can be,
If you only open up the door
Love is love can be,
The one you've always known
Love is love can be,
If you only open up your eyes
Love is love can be,
Always there for you to hold
