SHADOW
Walk into the shadows
of desire with
me
Taste these lips
full of passion
See the wanting
in my eyes
Caress my breast
with
Your gentle touch
Feel the heat that
warms my body
As we become one
In the shadows
Let are passion
and desire
be filled
Then wraped in
each others arms
We sleep deep
in the shadows
beneath the
trees.
