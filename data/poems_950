SUNSHINE OF JOY
Sunshine of joy at its best
Sets my frame of mind at rest
Restoring it to be blest
Yields it to dash to the crest
Sunshine of joy works outright
To create my dwelling bright
And wholesome with great delight
My frame of mind is felt tight
Sunshine of joy is such thrill
Gives me so much love to fill
Abundance of pleasure to till
Its base of nature stays still
