FEAR
Fear is here
Fear is near
Fear is what makes us pathetic human
Why cant we see the clear acumen?
Fear is only in the mind
that we always try to find
To keep our pride strong and high
Under fear there lives deny
of us bringing fear to life
its stabs you with a knife
kicks you in the face
brings you damn disgrace
bites you on the nose
takes away your clothes
leaves you in the nude
make you his own food
takes your kids away
leaves you in a day
to see that you are fear
