SORROW'S BANE
Love is the one thing
That keeps our spirits whole
When Sorrow comes a knocking
With hurts that touch our soul
When our world falls around us
Darkness fills our dreams
It’s love that lifts our spirits
Bridging Sorrow's streams
Love calls us from the brink
Of being swallowed by the stream
Dispels depression
And warms us in it’s gleam
Love helps us through the horror
Of love lost or led astray
Through mans trespass
Or angels spirit them away
Love comes to give us comfort
And wipe away the tears
Love will shield our spirits
When Sorrow's shadow nears
Love’s light whisper
Will stifle Sorrow's gain
In life’s losses
Love is Sorrow’s bane
