RUSH
The touch of your skin
Feels like a dream
As I inhale your scent
And dropp into a trance
My heart races and aches
From the pleasure I get in your presence
Your essence suffocating me with pure pleasure
I explode and elope with every touch
Brush against your thigh
Just to get high
Sigh when you smile in my direction
Giving my heart an erection so hard
It stops for a while
