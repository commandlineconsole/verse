*RAIN AND TEAR*
I'was first that my hopes, the angel came to remove my tear*
The rainbow i'm so sorry if today i'have sadness*
The blue sky i'm so sorry if today i'have sadness*
My dove i'm so sorry if today i'have sadness*
My flowers in the garden i'm so sorry i'have sadness*
The Lord in heaven i'm so sorry if today i'have sadness*
The downpour descended from sky*
Where today my eyes yearn for the face of my sweetheart*
I'was first that my hopes, the angel came to remove my tear*
I'never saw the face of my sweetheart forevermore*
Him hid far in sea, hid far behind the sun*
The downpour descended from sky*
Rain was the face of my sweetheart*
Where he was crying from heaven*
Cried I'saw rain*
Face rain of my sweetheart*
I'was first that my hopes*
The angel came to remove my tear**
