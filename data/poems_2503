TYPING TO HARD
Thumping away with no remorse
Typing too hard
No need to take out anger on a keyboard
Scream at the wall stamp the floor
But don’t type away as if each key is a member of year 9.
They’re rude
They have no sense of personal hygiene
They don’t want to learn
Scream away at them if will
But don’t take your anger out on a keyboard.
