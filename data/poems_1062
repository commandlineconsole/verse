THE HEART BEATS SPECIALLY FOR YOU
You are the only One to matter
True Joy forever
We are to go
You remain
And bring again
Oh! Life
You gave me joy
(It was not just a toy)
You won't take what you give
You help the heart to strive
I know
It just might be a too long life
And you sure better know
May be you send cold winter in spring
To save me some flowers in winter to bring
Make for me a rainbow when it must rain
Make me content
As long as my heart sees You're here
I can live and cheer
And though at twenty one
I miss the past pure joy
Of eight or two or one
I know I will go on
And get of life the new
As much I do long for the new
Yours is the new
Still You more joy will give
Oh God!
Send of you - Love -
A gaurdian to my heart
To wipe the hard
With each heart- beat
And every year
This special day
Come to renew.
(written on my 21st birthday)
