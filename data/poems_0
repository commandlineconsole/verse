>>O LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IS MY LOVE (AN ODE)
I love my love
As love should love
But you never love
As my love should love me.
you  got your  colourful wings
and you  fly
but I am never invited
left as  a flower without butterfly
You are the wish
You are the desire
Every one loves to fill with
But my heart pangs in despair.
Even if I  close my eyes and shut my mind
My heart knows you come  in   as a rain
In the hearts of people but mine I find
In the desert under unbearable wreathing pain.
