I DON'T CARE:
I don't care:
They don't get our love for each other,
They never did,
They never will.
But you know what?
I really don't care,
What they think, what they feel,
About us together,
It's not their decision for us to be together,
They can go somewhere,
I don't care.
Don't care what they think
Don't care what, nor how they feel,
I just don't care...
