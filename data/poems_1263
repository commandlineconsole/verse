FIGHT WITH DELIGHT
Stopping the fight
Wish to hold you tight
Set everything right
Stay near my sight
You are my true delight
Whole day and Night
Don't let happiness get blighted
Keep the candle of love lighted
Hold you close not by might
But love so pure and bright
Setting new love's height
Be my queen and me your knight
Only love should rule the relation
Live life with love, passion and emotion
Be frank and upright
For you a poem I write
Remembering your love bite
Being quiet and polite
Your presence does excite
Your lovely eyes do invite
Not to sleep tonight
Fight but fight with delight
Turning off the light
