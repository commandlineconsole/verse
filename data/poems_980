CONCATENATION VERSE
Silence is the best answer,
Answer to man's life is patience,
Patience is the weapon for success,
Success lives in labour with perseverance.
Courage dwells in patience,
Patience in trials brings forth fruit,
Fruit of joy can be shared with all,
All ought to fight against evils.
Where there's a will, there's a way,
Way is one unto the victory of joy,
Joy is everyone's right blessed by God,
God is the Author of mankind.
