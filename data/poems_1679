SECOND TIME AROUND
Fictional:
I remember September
in the autumnal rain,
when we gave up the pleasure
and ignored love's refrain.
A Last Waltz was the answer
to unite us again...
of course, you were the dancer
to set hearts aflame.
Now we'll stay together
no hand waves from the train.
We will treasure the pleasure
without heartache or pain.
