PAINS IN THE HEART
hurtful feelings beneat our
fragile hearts,
pains that occurs during
sadness
emotion in our thoughts
feeling the pains in sadness
in our heart
hurtful pain that can't stop
tears coming out our eyes
but never stop to flood away
tears running out your eyes like
endless waterfall.
pain hurtting and hurtting my heart
both body and mind
illusion of unhappy moments
anger of those that we hate
but the more we thing the more
pain we suffer.
wonder when pain will stop.
