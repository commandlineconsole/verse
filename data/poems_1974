RETURN WITH VICTORY
A distance shared
A wall built up
A view from a far
On a cold but sunny morn
Smiley faces
Arms wide open
Surprise, surprise
Cheers to them all
The fearful and weaken
Damaged and sad
At last found
Strength! Courage!
Determined to succeed
So long they have sought
Nesting in places
Away for so long
Humbled and faithful
Victory! Victory!
Long suffering no more
Victory! Victory!
Triumphant over death
