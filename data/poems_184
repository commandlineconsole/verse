IF LOVE
If love could be another word,
If love always is true,
If love’s all the world’s about,
Then Honey, love is you.

If love, my love, is perfect,
If love, my love, is fine,
If love, my love, is love divine,
Then for you, my love, I pine.
If love is romantic modulation,
If love’s my heart’s only consideration,
If love is love’s only calculation,
Then I have but love’s declaration.
Can a man love a woman,
And not want to love her more?
Can a man love a woman,
And not want to be loved even more?
If love, my love, is the question,
If love, my love, is the solution,
Then you, my love, are my occupation,
My one and only adoration!
