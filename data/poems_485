A PASSION FOR A HAT
A passion for a hat
Passion is for people who can have passion
Love is for everyone, time and time again
Letters for mistakes can altar a mind
Too much of the same can dull the person's precious time
But what if to find the kind of love that can sun burn your heart
Poison your heart, blacken your heart
What if, what if, why do you call me, why, why, why, hello
Nothing lasts forever, donâ€™t you know meow says the cat so I hit it with a baseball bat
Not for being a cat but for peeing on my favorite hat
