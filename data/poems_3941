CARES
Life without care as well a love and understanding is not worth living
Even though care in itself is deceptive
A mere feel of captivates the mind
And you become enslaved to it snare
Anyone can be a slave to care
Because it grips the heart
It makes the strong weak
A soften a solid mind
People who are priviledged to gain it real
Takes it for granted
those that deserve it struggle to no avail
Deep inside the urge for care pierces
And it seem like you are grinded to pieces
Then you let out a glow on ur faces
Before your breathe seizes
