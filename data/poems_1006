HAPPINESS FLOOR
Life has memories
That are happy and new
That everyone treasures
As it gives joy true
And makes the way
And opens the door
For much more joys
On the happiness floor
I wish for your days
To be filled with fain
Where you never meet
With any type of pain
So tomorrow will bring
Hopes and dreams all new
And fill your life
With much joy for you.
