TEACHING THE HARDENED YOUTH
Teaching to hardened youth
Anger, Cold, Hard Anger
The eyes Hateful, his face pinched
How dare I try to tell him
That his choices brought him this.
Why is this important?
This is a waste of time.
Leave me alone witch
My future is mine to find.
These skills I try and teach you
Will make that future prime
It isn't in the details
But in the use of your mind.
People will try and manipulate
To use you for their own
You need to be smarter
And Walk your path alone
Friends will always be there
Some will lead the way
Others will block your path
To improve their life another day.
You are an individual
You allow others to make the rules
Questions every reason
Or be their little fool.
Your brain is your treasure
The more you use the more you have
Step up to the plate
And find your own path
Be educated in your choices
Know what it is your want
Always seek the answers
Your intelligence to flaunt
It is cool to be the dumb kid
Middle School is a pain
The future is coming
Try not to disdain.
I fight this fight today
I fought it yesterday
I believe in the future
This youth will lead the way.
He is full of anger
They are all overcome by hate
They are frightened and alone
And terrified of the worlds fate.
We have left them a mess
A broken planet from excess
A fragmented democracy
A future filled with stress
Support them as I can
Teach them to believe
For it is in their minds
That one solution we need.
