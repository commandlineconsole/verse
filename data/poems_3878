MY LIFE
My life is like a dark hole,
No one cares about me,
My family loves me but not much,
I hate my life,
I wish it was better,
I wish someone would care,
I wish someone would understand,
I wish I could die.
'This poem is for everyone that they don't think anyone can understand them or even care about them. Just remember there is at least one or more people that love you ans care about you.'
