FEAR ONLY HOLDS YOU BACK
Let go of your fear
Because it only holds you back
And it interferes
It may smell like a lilac
But its deadly
It destroys people
Its no medley
I have gone through it
It leaves a foul taste behind
Its best just to split
Believe me fear is not kind
Fear only holds you back
Its better to get over it
Before it attacks
If your feeling scared fear is the culprit
Just get over it.
