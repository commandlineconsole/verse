BROKEN TOMORROW'S
Broken tomorrow's
And time only borrowed
As soldiers they write
To their moms and dads
Their husbands their children
Their wives
I'm doing alright
And I've seen some sights
And I'm proud to be
As I stand for free
I'm doing what's right
The soldier he writes
Don't worry of me
I'll be alright
Broken tomorrow's
Letters of sorrows
He is coming home
With his name in stone
Such are the sorrows
Broken tomorrow's
Forever is sleeping
In heavens keeping
I'm coming home
Someone is so alone
As they read the few lines
Of the last of his life.
