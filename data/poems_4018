PARODY OF TO BE OR NOT TO BE (TO DIE OR NOT TO DIE)
To die or not to die, that is the question:
Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer this life
Whether to live in this cruel world,
Or give up and live in the next,
And by ending it all. To sleep—forevermore
For to sleep there will be no need to suffer,
But for the ones who are left behind. Their suffering,
Will never cease. Unless-they take the same escape as you,
And so the never ending cycle of death will never go extinct
For there are always be someone who cares. Unless,
Living a solitary life full of misery and self-confinement
‘Tis better to live with people who care rather to live with people who don’t care
And by living a hermit. To live—to die—to sleep—all alone—forevermore
‘Tis better to live with people who care rather than to,
Live all alone with no one around to see when you fall
‘Tis better to live—to breathe—to die—with people around,
To catch—when you fall
To die—to sleep—to have nightmares—forevermore
For to sleep means never to be awake. For to,
Be awake—means to live—to live means to be awake
For to be awake means to live with life’s sorrows
‘Tis your choice to live with life’s sorrows
‘Tis your choice to live all alone
‘Tis your choice to have friends to deal with life’s troubles
‘Tis your choice alone—not anyone else’s
To die around a crowd of people who don’t care
Or to die around one person cares rather than,
A crowd who doesn’t care
To give life a pause—to analyze your life—to decide,
Are you surrounded by a crowd that doesn’t care?
Or surrounded by one friend who cares more than a whole crowd—combined
‘Tis time to decide if life is truly worth living with a crowd,
Or being alone with one friend who cares
To face death all alone is a recipe for your own destruction
To face death with friends is a recipe for life
To travel alone on the path of darkness will breed darkness,
But with light—darkness must succumb to light
Light must defeat darkness
For in darkness therein lies our own fate—our own personal hell,
While in light therein lies our future—our own inner sanctuary
‘Tis better to fly with wings towards the light,
Rather than to fly without wings towards the darkness
Thus we must be careful of how we fly and where we fly
We might end up at the big black gate of death
With our sins on our lips,
But never spoken—forevermore
