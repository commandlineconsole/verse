DO NOTHING TO DESTROY THE JOY
Do nothing to destroy the joy
That was Yesterday - the day
Of the Birthing of your Manchild
Any destroying or diminution
Can come only from within you
There is only one person who
Can destroy that yesterday
Or any yesterday - You
If you destroy that Yesterday
For You - You may also
Be destroying it - for whom
The day was made - and by whom
The Joy was made - Donâ€™t destroy
The Joy of Yester Day for Him
And you - En Joy It Every Day
