~BETWEEN LOVE AND FEAR~
We often think that
most of the difficult choices are between
whats right and whats wrong
when the reality is more between
whats right and whats easy
but even then
in the heart of that,
the core,
the very root of it all
is the choice between
love and fear
fear is the mind killer
the dream stealer that will
immobilize you in place
push you back
into the comfort of misery,
b/c misery is the only company you know
fear will keep you
deaf and
blind and
silence
whatever possibilities of more or different
that would ever dare
leave your tongue
fear will keep you
as its companion
locked in the maze of the known
of discontent
of neglect
and ab/use
residing in the dis/comfort
of dis/ease
whispering lies
and half truths
sometimes even old truths
that are no longer true
holding you still
unable
unwilling
to move towards the light
because it too fears,
it fears the Light
the Light will reveal fear
for the poser it is
the imposter
the dark magic
that has weaved enchantments
that have stolen
your power
your Self
because it has disconnected you
from Love
and convinced you
that what you’ve had all along
what has been known
and shown to you
since your first breath
has been love,
though an imperfect love
because fear can not dwell
in the presence of
Perfect Love
in the presence of
It’s Light
fear is cast down and
revealed for
the deceiver that it is
Perfect Love is
patient with imperfect people
actively does good
is nonpossessive
and noncompetitive
it believes in you
and wants only whats best for you
it is unselfish
and full of grace
it is forgiving
and comforting
it seeks and champions truth
it defends and protects
believes the best in others
it never gives up
and is there always
remaining loyal
Love
true and perfect and unconditional
can be fear inducing,
it is not easy
it is not to be taken lightly
or entered into unwisely,
but it is nothing to fear
for Love will catch you
when you fall
and hold you up
and build you up
wants and seeks only
whats best for you
Love will encourage you
to be who you are created to be
not hold you back in shadow
or push when you’re not ready
it will wait on and for you
never leaving
never diminishing
only being
and still being
here
for you
when you are ready
to choose between
love and fear
