FEAR ITSELF
Does fear hold us back
From dreams unfulfilled
Love allowed to drift away
Passions allowed to wither
Does fear envelop us
Will we face it all our life
Do we stand behind the curtain of fear
Afraid to audition hope
Fear need not be our anchor
Taking us down
It can steady our bow
Root us to steady growth
Fear restrains us
From escaping the thorns of pain
It misdirects prayer to an unknown
A misbelief wrapped like a mask
Obscuring visions of the future
Though fear may be a curse
Itâ€™s a confrontation we must make
Face to face, we cannot break
Let it provide the edge
That from failure comes new challenges
Sweep fear under the rug
So we may tread lightly on its face
Knowing its claws are ready to lure us
Hence we look back for its approach
Success will defeat fear every time
But we must keep the weed killer handy
Fear grows at every concrete corner
And no tombstone can hold it back
So we fight fear as an ever long battle
As we struggle daily to win the war
