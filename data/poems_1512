COMMAâ€™ SUTRA
, Passion raves
, Dig her voluptuously
, Burning for pleasure
, Flower plucked.
, Untamed intenseness
, Closeness of two hearts
, Beating as one
, Unchained excess & rapture.
, Frequent repetition
, Incessant love
, No innocence
, Mutual appetite for more.
, Position means everything
, Elevation is hot
, Mouths gravitate
, Man & woman as one.
, Regenerate the senses
, Hear, smell, taste, touch
, Sexual pleasure
, Tender love.
, Delight with the feeling
, Like sweet summer rain
, Pleasure with delicacy
, Bodily fluids exchanged again.
