A CROSS TO BEAR
What's the point of trying
When all I seem to do is end up crying
The cross I bear
Gets heavier the more I care
Maybe if I didn't give a f#*k
I'd find a bit of luck
I wish I could back up to a certain day
When all my problems were still 6 years away
The cross I bear
Gets heavier the more I care
The future used to be exciting
Now its bound to be non stop fighting
I gave her my all!
Built myself up to fall
The cross I bear
Gets heavier the more I care
I messed up when I stated to care
Love just isn't fair, , ,
