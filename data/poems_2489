A MONUMENT TO DISTORTED LOVE.
Eating away inside my thoughts
Years of anger making me blind
When the monster within takes control
Invading
Consealing
Consuming my mind
Bitterness rises up
It surges, it feeds, it destroys those I love
It controls from within like a puppet on a glove
How can you love this monster in me?
The anger so strong, so deep within
All I want is to run and hide
Forever burning deeper sins
To get away from this monster within
