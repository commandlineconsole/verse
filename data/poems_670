THE DEVIL
This WOMAN is work of none other than The Devil,
Look deep into HER eyes and discover,
Fiery passion for blood,
And thrusting sense of corruption,
Look deep ito HER soul,
To reveal the power that so many have tasted,
But so few have envisioned.

Look deep into HER heart and discover,
The shame that once led a boy to danger,
Through faults which cannot be determined from either side,
As a fault.
Look on and wonder where the next turn will lead you
PASSION?
DESTRUCTION?
