GUERNIKA
What a joy is my day    what a joy
when Karl Waters sings
lambs of the crying out of dizziness
make an Ascent
and a slant woman flatten a rope on the Globe
Karl Waters makes a lift from the corners
and at the madhouse some alms cookies
there is a rope over the Globe in black
and a woman comes back from Guernika
