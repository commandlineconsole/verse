ANGER
Anger kills the happiness of the soul and heart.
Anger destroys the face of beauty.
Anger gives the wrath of death.
Anger gives reason to kill.
Beauty's anger destroys the plan for the future.
Never can anger be calmed except with the voice of your loved one.
Without the voice there's still hope.
Hope for a bright future.
Anger makes you cry.
Anger can just be covered with a smile not from the heart.
Never make someone angry.
