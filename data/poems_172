WHAT IS LOVE?
Love is giving, love is kind,
Love is gentle, love is blind.
Love is meek, love is bold,
Love is warm, love is cold.
Love is strong, love is weak.
Love is open, love is discreet.
Love is blue, love is glad,
Love is happy, love is sad.
Love is true, love is cruel,
Love is empty, love is full.
Love is sentimental, love is sharing,
Love is generous, love is caring.
Love is humor, love is laughter,
Real love is forever after.
