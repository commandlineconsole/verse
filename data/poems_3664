WHO CARES
There are those who care for you
There are those who care about you
There are those who care because of what they can get from you
There are those who say they care
There are those who pretend to care about you
There are those who care out of guilt
There are those who care less about you
But who cares whether someone care about you
I do, because I know that God loves and will always care for you.
