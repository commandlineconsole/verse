AN ORDINARY MAN
I am just an ordinary man
With just an ordinary concern
Out of a few billions, I am one
I live, work, play, love, cry, laugh and yearn
I am simply like you, I mean you
With same problems and same solutions
The same faces, places, nothing's new
I see the same story, same passion.
I live today, I die tomorrow
Please... tell me what do you see in me!
Life's a hodgepodge of joy and sorrow?
I have no purpose, no recourse but thee!
I want something new out of this blue.
Fulfillment by, for my restless soul.
Abjudge not where I go; but whereto?
I want not this role; please the scroll!
