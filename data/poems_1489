PLEASURE AND PAIN
Pleasure and pain are the same
or am i going insane.
pleasure and pain are the same
or am i playing a little game.
the pain is so real i cant breath
the pleasure so real i could bear to leave.
My heart stops,
My mind goes blank,
My body yearns,
My soul desires.
Your smell,
Your look,
Your walk,
Your voice,
Your eyes,
Your body.
i thirst for your touch like
a Forrest thirsts for water.
i cut myself to feel the pain
that turns into pleasure
that turns into fear.
fear for what i am becoming
and
fear that i will never find
someone else like you.
pleasure that can not be saited
on my own,
pain that immobilizes me.
i am afraid of what i am becoming
pleasure that only you can sait
pain that i enjoy.
