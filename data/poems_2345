UNFOLDING THE CYCLE
You can't destroy
anger by anger
cruelty by cruelty
or
hate by hate.
As daylight
can be seen
through very small holes
so
little things
reveal your character
thus
anger- can be overcome by forbearance
cruelty- can be overcome by non-violence
and
hate- can be overcome by charity and compassion.
