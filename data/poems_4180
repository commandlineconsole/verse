A FEAR OUT OF MANY
If I asked you the simple question
Would you say that you fear nothing at all
Or would you lie saying you fear everything you saw
If you asked my what would I say?
Two days ago probably would have shrugged saying: idk
But at the moment I a true fear
I would would say i fear something
But i cannot because this you cannot see
Nor could you touch
But I feel it to the bone
You wanna know my fear?
I fear of being all alone
