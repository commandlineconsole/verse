WE MUST REALIZE
We live on a planet where everyone dies,
But what is the truth no one realize.
To Whom It May Concern our birth certificate shows,
But who concerns the mother earth no one knows.

We live on a planet where everyone dies,
But how to live that life no one realize.
We think only about our self ones busy life shows,
But who think about the protector earth no one knows.
We live on a planet where everyone dies,
But what is life all about no one realize.
They talk about politics, they talk about terrorists, they all care it really shows,
But who cares about the mother earth no one knows.
We live on a planet where everyone dies,
But then think of that day when we will live and our planet will die!
This is the truth that we must realize.
We live on a planet and we have to keep it alive...
