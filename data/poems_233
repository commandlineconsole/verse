FORBIDDEN LOVE
What do you call forbidden love?
A love that is banned by society rank
A love that is cursed by blood relation
A love that is tied by legal bond
But still it wore the name of love
What do you say about forbidden love?
A love that is not given a place in the world
A love that doesn't have future
A love that fated full of misery and judgement
But still you may be burned in love
What do you think about forbidden love?
A love that should not grow
A love that should not be felt
A love that should not ever cross your mind
But still it is a kind of love
What do you fear with forbidden love?
A love that smells dangerous
A love that creates scandal
A love that brings destruction
But still you could fall in love
What do you see with forbidden love?
A love that raises your hidden desire
A love that bears a sinful pleasure
A love that fills your untamed imagination
But still it has a touch of love
