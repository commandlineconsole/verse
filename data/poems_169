SHE DON'T LOVE ME
I love her but she don’t love me
She thinks she love another man
And he’s no good you understand
I love her but she don’t love me
Running round drinking every night
He’ll never treat my baby right
I love her but she don’t love me
She don’t know the things he does
She don’t know the women he loves
I love her but she don’t love me
How long before she quits the chase
Seeing chasing that man is a total waste
I love her but she don’t love me
He’s not the kind to settle down
Breaking hearts all over town
I love her but she don’t love me
I tell her every chance I get
She’s not ready to accept that yet
I love her but she don’t love me
I’m going to get me that girl
Show her that she is my world
I love her but she don’t love me
Can’t anyone love her as I do
If you knew her you’d love her to
I love her she don’t love me
I have loved her for many years
She caused me to shed many tears
I love her she don’t love me
Thinking of her my heart bleeds
I’m always there anytime she needs
I love her but she don’t love me
I’ll live in misery on my own
If I can’t have her I’ll die alone
