064. TOGETHERNESS
I entered her world with passions unbound,
She received me in joy with passions all round;
She, her wings apart, tightly seized my girth,
I, swollen and big, dipped deeper inside,
Feeling warm flows drowning me in her;
She was like honey, enlivening my passage,
She held me inside in flood of passions.
Every move I made, stirred her to higher state,
Flooding her well with more and more streams,
Every stir I had, had joyous onrush in her,
Every push I gave had her tremble in joy;
I could feel her plea not to come out of her,
Nor did I want to root out me from her treasure:
Sweet passions of her held me in warm comfort.
In ceaseless sweet streams that flooded her world,
I joyously swelled and swam in unbound pleasure,
As if Iâ€™m the regal head all over inside her;
Every brush I had on her delicate walls,
Sent her to frenzied joy of our togetherness;
I soon moved to her limits, and fused our cores,
And saw the souls of us blossoming as a whole.
