A CHILDS SADNESS
Why do I feel this sadness deep inside
Is it mistakes that I try to hide?
Like a drowning victim gasping for air
Your chest becomes tight and your hearts in despair.
Like a wind blown feather landing on the ground
You want to scream, but you don’t make a sound.
Hundreds of people all around
Yet this sadness gets you down.
You don’t know how or why you get this way
You just want to hide - or run away.
Some get sad for menial things
But this is what sadness brings.
So this thought I will inflict
“ you have to get over it really quick”.
Sadness can pull you down, especially
When there’s no help around.
TAKE YOUR LIPS AND SPREAD THEM WIDE
AND PULL OUT THAT LAUGHTER FROM DEEP INSIDE.
Did you feel the difference that it brought
This is what I was taught.
