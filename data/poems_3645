DROP IT IN A WISHING WELL
Forget the dime l left behind,
two sense is what l meant.
Give it to another who cares,
my concern dripples not fair.
You have illed me, why don't
you got it over with, and kill me.
Wipe away pain
Wrap it with chains,
you have nothing to gain.
Forget what was
remember what is,
cause it will lead you
to what may come.
