MY LITTLE WONDER
My little wonder
The star I’m under
That sparkly pleasure
Is going forever
Holding tight to the rope
Hoping not to let go
Hoping for better hope
Hoping for you to know
See the difference like I tend to notice your shine
Know who I am like I know your mine
The pleasure in thunder
Makes me wonder
What have I done?
To be pushed that under
Under into the none
I loved you then and I love you so
What have I done to deserve this is what I want to know
The stars are still above
The ground is still under
You are still my love
And my little wonder…
