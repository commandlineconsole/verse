THE WAY TO PEACE
Forget about your country's history
To hell with all the zionistic imagery
The grudges that you hold don't matter really
I don't care about your religious integrity
Who cares if they fired SCUD's and killed your children?
Peace will be with all if you can love them
Forget about your fake democracy
It doesn't matter if some of your voters seem to disagree
The prisoners that you hold don't matter really
I don't care about your political integrity
Who cares if they were the cause of 9/11?
Peace will be with all if you can love them
Forget about your hatred for Mugabe
If you cut him, he will surely bleed
The corpses that you hold don't matter really
I don't care about your family's integrity
Who cares if he feels more of a man by killing them?
Peace will be with all if you can love him
Forget about your devastating enemy
Don't worry about the countless chargeless detainees
The borders that you hold don't matter really
I don't care about your cultural integrity
Who cares if they've still been judged to be olympian?
Peace will be with all if you can love them
Forget about your country's civil liberties
Don't worry about the terrorist LTTE
The buddhist monks you hold don't matter really
I don't care about your Sinhalan integrity
Who cares if you're ignored by all the UN?
Peace will be with all if you can love them
