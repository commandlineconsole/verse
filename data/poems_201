LOVE
Love makes you feel warm inside
Love is always by your side
Love itâ€™s the work of cupid
Love is so strong, its stupid
Love is so confusing
Love make you feel that your never losing
Love is forever
Love can bring two together
Love can bring you one guarantee
Love means that you will always have me
Love is the strongest emotion
Love is strong devotion
Love works day and night
Love is what brings you light
Love is blessed from above
Love is as beautiful as a turtle dove
