JOY, FOREVER
I know not why my mind feels gay
with the trees, I want to sway
in the midst of flowers, I want to play
I feel some joy, I've found today
Joy, it feels, like a candle lit,
fairies of  hope surrounding it
It feels to me like the glowing Sun,
like a yarn of happiness unspun
It feels like a top, swerving around
on its tip, dancing, along the ground
Joy, it seems, like a dropp in an ocean,
It feels like the drink of a magic potion
Joy, I hope, you forever remain
always ready to relieve my pain,
To let life see me smile always
Through out the nights, and my days.
