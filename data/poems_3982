C.A.R.E?
What do care mean?
Is it just a methaphor for love?
Or something bigger than love itself.
How do you care for someone?
Where do care come from?
Is it an emotion?
Or an expression?
Maybe it's just some letter put together to make a word that doesn't mean anything.
Could it mean something real special and mean something deep?
Like one step to loving.
Who know the really thing about care?
Old school and new school is it the same meaning for the same word that was once spoken a long time ago which is still spoken today and maybe in the near future.
Is care a part of a culture or is it spiritual?
Do anyone knows care from the roots of love?
