THE MEANING OF LIFE.
Whats the meaning of life
does anybody care
do you think an old women whos gone through a war
lost her husband, children and living on her own
does she really cares.
A man with a broken leg
doesnt really care
a son who lost his mum
doesnt really care
someone suffering in some poverty stricken town
doesnt really care
a young boy without a family
doesnt really care
a man who's dying in pain
doesnt really care.
Meaning of life is pointless
does anybody care
there is no need to answer it
just be happy that we have it
life doesnt have a meaning
just get on with it
nobody should care.
Always remember poeple dont care
poeple who lost love ones
dont really care
poeple who have given up on life
ask them if theres a meaning of life
do they really care.
Nobody cares
and nobody should
the meaning of life is up in smoke
there is no answer
there never should
there never will be
nobody should ever care
the meaning of life is here now
care for it while it's still there
do you really care about the meaning of life?
