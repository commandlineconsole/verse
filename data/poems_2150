I HAVE A ENOUGH POEM'S RESERVE. IS IT ENOUGH?
should i write
more,
simpler,
or should i
just
calm down?
writing is my land escape
my visual art corner
my music
all my fantasies
all my explored and unexplored dramas.
should i keep
writing until
i will be empty
and de-hydrated.
or may be by writting
i will find my way.
who knows,
i keep trying until
something will come up
by surprise.
and like surprises
and adventures
i like the unknown
the impossible
so i write for that.
for that unknown.
