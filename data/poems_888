THE BALANCE
The sting of time dances on
In the night and early morn
Singing of love gained and love lost
We are left to count the cost
Sorrow visits then goes away
Joy awakens a brand new day
When joy dances and sings with you
Sorrow lay asleep waiting for its time to
It is in the balance we stand
Between the two we take their hand
Who can say which is greater
Who holds the scale between now and later
By what infinite measure shall we weigh
The joy and sorrow that visits each day
For both are bound together by love
Pulling at us with the push and the shove
From joy the happiness from  sorrow the pain
Making our lives full with the loss and the gain
Within each our growth is found
The larger we grow the smaller the sound
Of joy and sorrow we hear
For they shall mark every year
That we draw breath upon the earth
Showing to each of us what love is worth
