#    EPICENTER
within this
ball of a world
i fear....
i die with fear
not like the body
...the mind
within this
ball of a world
i fear...
i die with fear
the body
feels the wind as a friend
it walks and breathes
in full confidence
not like the body
....the mind
it fears
it dies with fear
UNTIL...UNTIL
it befriends the soul
to realize
it is the epicenter
of this whole world
