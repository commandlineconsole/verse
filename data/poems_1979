CONSTANT WELTSCHMERZ (ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY)
Exclamation points are little lies we tell each other
In this digital age it's easier to feign surprise or excitement
When in actuality, nothing surprises anyone anymore
Now - disgust, apathy and scarily even hate
These things you can't disguise electronically as easily
And sadly even less so face to face
The Eyes can tell no Lies
