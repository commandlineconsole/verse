NIGHTS OF DREAM
Heart when shattered
heaved to heal
as greatness unveils
the soul yet divine
Hope being whispered
by the tunes distant
the pain as disowned
melts river into the flow
night as brings the mirth
tender flow passing the stream
with glorious blunder.
as it is not one or two,
but dissipated all
in the nights of dream
Sadness comes to end
as the mind when revels
happiness when conquered
hate being exiled
Love sprouts the rhythm
sadness shrinking
hope when come again.
