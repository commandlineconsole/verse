BEGINNING OF NEW SPRING
Beginning of new spring
Is a chant sweet of everything
Of the green in glowing gold
When earth summers unfold
Every stream river's play
In a fresh waves that won’t stay
When tomorrow shall bring
Fresh scent of early spring
Every hour of love
With the cloudlets far above
When the haze is sifting high
Thru the morning of dawn’s sky
Ready to the day’s awake
From the cold and yearning’s ache
As its mood grows in a trance
Full with breezes and fragrance
March closure to new April
When green becomes the hill
Every hour of longings true
Pleasures moments going thru
As the day in night glows
And the blossoms all grows
Filling pleasures moments high
On the earth and blue sky
