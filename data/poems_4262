FEAR OF YOU
I fear of you leaving me all alone
Leaving me to suffer with pain
Fear of you hating me
Hating me 'cause I tried to help you when you didn't want me to
Fear of you wanting to kill me
Like every other guy that kills their girl
I fear that you will turn in to someone that your not
I fear of you
