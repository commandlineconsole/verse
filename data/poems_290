LOVE IS ONLY PHYSICS
Love is not an enduring emotion
Love is not an infinite passion
Love is not related to the heart beats
Love is not about dreams and trances
Love is neither revealed nor imagined
Love is no more running in the carotids
Love is neither Biochemistry nor Parapsychology
Love is just about fulfilling needs
Love ends when our expectations wither
Love is like a game being played on the cell phones
Love is a broadband or the invisible wire
Love is being viewed through the webcam of my laptop
Love is directly proportional
To how much physical time
You can offer to your beloved
In simple and plain words
Today
Love is only Physics
