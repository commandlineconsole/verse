CRACK PERSON
I had chance to think back
Over lost period in life as crack person
I always refused to surrender
For logic which was not offering any thunder
I used to boost” I am what I am “
I shall stay as it is and according to plan
“How lo lead life should only be the concern “
I refused to listen anything or learn
No doubt, I was man of independent outlook
With complete calm to think over stock
Turn it in favor and sail through storm
But failed to capitalize on the relation warm
Everything was alright but for the sake of one
I did not take seriously the concern of any one
It gave me title of “arrogant and stupid one”
Even thought the case was the same as thought over one
Yes, person should maintain integrity and character
As he is sole judge and actor
He has to think what is good for him as sailor
Life boat has to be pulled with honor
Be judge but never misjudge
The mood of people should not turn into grudge
They will respect only they get in turn
Your duty is to reciprocate and return
