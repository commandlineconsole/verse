TRAVEL MACAO HAIKU - GIVING WAY TO A MUSLIM WOMAN AT A MA TEMPLE
I give way to
a muslim woman and family
to take pictures with A Ma
The A Ma temple about 500 years old is the oldest temple in Macao. The goddess A Ma or Mazhu like the one in Taiwan is a patron saint  of fishermen. While in the temple, I was surprised by a tudonged girl (girl with shroud over the head)   at the altar busy taking pictures with her family. I had to make way for them so that they could take a shot where A Ma is at their rear. I was very surprised because Muslims have always been discouraged to visit temple since Islam is a monotheistic religion. It was really an eye opener.
