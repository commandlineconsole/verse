LOST IN CROWD
It is like to be lost in crowd
You have voice and concern but can not speak loud
You have no reason to be unfair and feel proud
But certainly she has point to prove and feel good
There is no point in telling the truth
It requires no words to be shown as proof
You can not be isolated or remain aloof
You have no choice either to go and shout on roof
She has known her out numbered for days
She wants to be fully contended in possible ways
The main concern with her is to know who her real is
Who will be real one to shed the tears and miss?
Reassurance can not come simply by speaking untruth
To go back from words means crushing the tongue between teeth
It is simple way to feel the holiness of bond
You are part of small creatures in the pond
It is always taken for yes in dire needs
The rest of the life may pass on with speed
How best one can rely upon is matter in question?
It is to be thoroughly probed before entering the relation
