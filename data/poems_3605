SINGLE PARENTING
An uncompleted home with one parent
Lost the charm and radiance
Comfort of the necessities
And lots of other amenities
Yet the single wheel cart
That does not look great mart
Affection shed in abundance
Faiths kept high on prudence
Yet there is a lack of love
Making us vulnerable as dove
Gone is the man to make her a widow
Search for the flowers in the meadow
But the strings of life attached
Where from the concern to detach
Gone is the woman to make him a widower
Search for the compassion of a woman
But the string of fates detached
Where from the world to rematch
Gone is the spouse under the legal ambit
The so called fashion word of divorce
But where is the solace to the child
Whose life is gone to toss and wild?
This is no topic to discuss mild
For it involves those concerned guide
To the single parenting father
It is the bigger pain of home to bother
Handling the kids and the home
Jumping into a game hitherto a spectator
To the single parenting mother
It is the higher responsibility to bother
Getting out of the cocoon of a homemaker
To jump into the shoes of a careermaker
Or sometimes both handling both of choice
A lesser choice but a great concern and care
To the single parented children
It is a phase of wild thoughts and tantrum
An uncompleted childhood
Usually having no time for robinhood
Worst of fear of the parent's loneliness
In the latter part of life no where a bliss
First few fears of a new parent in life
Who could be his best wife or a knife?
Or the cult of negligence on the emotions
For the parent is busy handling responsibilities
Or the guild of pampering for a fatherless child
Or overprotecting a motherless child from wild
How much ever the living parent does
It's for sure the children certainly miss
The completeness of the both parents together
Whether it is the fates or the decision that make
The life looks so incomplete in this world
As the child with this life and  thoughts grows  old
