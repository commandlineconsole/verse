ONE DAY
Life can seem so pointless
No one ever seems to care
The earth is a huge mess
But the topic choice is hair.
It kind of makes me mad,
This superficial way of life
When so many things are sad,
No one cares to end the stife.
So take heart, all of you
Those of material things
The big picture won't be shoes
No one will care for you flings.
The actual people will matter,
One day, all will care
Noone will listen to senseless patter,
And none will care about hair.
