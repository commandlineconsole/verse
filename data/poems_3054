WHEN SORROW IS FORGOTTEN
When sorrow is forgotten
the sun will be seen
your mind feels light and open
and your body that was once locked up in chains, is as free as a young eagle
When sorrow is forgotten
life presents you with the gift of love and happiness
your wings can dry from the tears that dampened them
and you can finally let go, and soar
The higher you fly, the lighter you feel
the weight that once kept you confined, starts to fall from your shoulders
your lungs can finally envelop the cool air
When sorrow is forgotten
your mind can think clearly again
your body is your temple again
and your heart can feel bliss again
