FREINDSHIP'S LIGHT
FRIENDSHIP'S LIGHT
Melvin Banggollay
F-riendship is so far the brightest light
R-edefining and guiding one's inherent right
I-nspiring one to share one's own plight
E-mpowring us to tell feelings outright
N-eutralizing comments against one's delight
D-efining how we make someone alright
S-erving and respecting others right
H-armonizing how we deal others' rights
I- nvigorating how we share love's delight
P-ro-active inter-action while on life's flight
S-haring one's ife to light other's plight.
