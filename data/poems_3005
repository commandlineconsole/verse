ROW
O row!
Row
in the name of
the fantastic-light
of the cryptic-night!
O row!
Row
the wine winning
like the wind winding
to push the pus
of the wound
in the world
of neither wrong or right
or either wrong or right
or both wrong or right
in the inmost of Mankind!
O row!
my Lovers
what kind thing can I do
for you
when the mind bombs
the marrow of Mankind?

O my Lovers
in the name of
the inmost marrow
of Mankind’s sorrow
let’s go dancing
and singing our songs
searching for joys!
Nine
Eight
Seven
Six
Five
Four
Three
Two
One
Zero!
Row, row our sorrow
like a ship of Noah
and go
smiling row!
Row, row our sorrow
like the lips of the sun
and go
shining row!

Row, row our sorrow
and grow
into the vastness
of the ocean, row!
Row, row our sorrow
and grow
into the mount
Everest, row!

And row of life
just row and row
into the Underworld
or Heaven!
O who can make it certain?
O don’t worry, my Lovers!
And row our death
only sorrow
in the inmost wound
or joy!
O who can make it certain
O don’t worry
take it easy,
my Lovers!
And let’s go Lovers!
our life and death
row and row
from the Unknown
rowing to Unknown
row and row
from the Universal Sorrow
Sorrow of Row!
O don’t worry
take it easy, my Lovers!
Row, row our Sorrow!
Row, row sincerely row,
my Lovers!
Row and row
up and up
our Sorrow
up and up
grow and grow
into Love
up and up
into Loving
up and up
Everlasting!
