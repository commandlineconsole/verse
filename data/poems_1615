CUP OF HAPPINESS
Drink some joy and some fun
From happiness cup before its done
Because the joy that you get from it
Holds in it pleasure kit
The kit of pleasure from where
Happiness can be gathered my dear
Which includes fun and fain
And friendly smiles to take away pain
So do it all and know in it
Joy will come bit by bit
So drink some joy and some fun
From it before your day is done.
