AN EVERYDAY HERO'S FAREWELL
I don’t have words today
Just silence
As I sit here feeling
How much I will miss you
Everyday
I don’t have words today
To capture the million stories we’ve shared
Over laughter, and sadness
More than a little, madness
And each brought us to this day
I don’t have words today
That will hug your heart
Always, with love
So you’d know that I’m never
Far, from you
I don’t have words today
That convey how proud I am of you
Of your many acts of kindness
Of humour in the face of sadness
You are a hero, to me.
