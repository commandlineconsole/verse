GREAT JOY
Just like life's grief
Great joys are brief
And comes in your way
And cross each life's day
They come and lightly touch
Our hearys and minds so much
That it starts giving joy
For all of us to enjoy
And show us life's view
Some nice and some new
That all smile and say
Enjoy it for a day
Because like all the griefs
Great joys are also brief.
