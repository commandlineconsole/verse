UNTITLED
Honey, here goes the total truth
I just can't hide it any longer
It's just no use in denying it
My feeling are only getting stronger
and stronger
So baby handle my emotions with care
It shows how it's all totally real
So treat me as I deserve, don't do me wrong
Lady, handle my situation with care
I'm trusting you with my reputation
even if it goes against my style
But please make the right interpretation
of how my feelings are
I pray for you under the stars
Don't take my attitude lightly
Honey, handle my pride with care
Now that you know I care about you
handle with care, just please be fair
about everything else and anything else
Handle my heart with care
