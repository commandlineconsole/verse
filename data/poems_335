TRUE LOVE
True love will never try to hurt you
True love is a whisper in its sound
True love may stray but it will not leave you
It will always remind you when it's not around
True love is a kiss whose meaning you cannot miss
True love is a kiss that lasts forever
True love is not fleeting
True love never shows its fist
True love everlasting
True love does not end
True love is the greatest virture
True love is the kindest friend
True love always grows
True love does not squander and always genlty sows
True love is gentle kindness
When you are sad, true love always knows
True love is unforgettable
Like rain and stars and snow
True love is the greatest gift you'll ever know
No matter how far you travel or where you ever go
True love is like a waterfall
Never stops and always flows
And touches you most gently
No matter where it goes
True love is everlasting
and always seems to stay
True love you fear may leave you
but it does never really stray
True love makes you smile
True love makes you laugh with glee
True love knows when to run to you
and when to let you be
True love wipes your tears in times of trouble
True love defends you when you're in deep
True love mends your broken feelings
and rushes to you when you weep
True love helps you to be your best
True love trusts in you
True love reassures you
Doesn't put you to a test
True love fills your heart with care
True love sees you and feels you there
True love opens up your guarded heart
and gives it a safe place to share
True love takes you by the hand
and caresses it with care
True love makes you feel needed
and part of an inseperable pair
True love is compassionate
and always aims to be fair
True love is so many things
wrapped in joy and love and care
True love is self-evident
True love is so unlikely and so rare
But you're heart will know true love for sure
You'll feel it everywhere and will know it by it's true care
