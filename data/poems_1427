LONELY HEARTS & STARRY NIGHTS! !
Lonely Hearts & Starry Nights! !
Lonely hearts and Starry nights,
Part of everyone's life,
Sometimes in heartbreaks,
Sometimes in delight,
Some nights the moon is shining bright,
And sometimes the eyes are crying,
Longing for her sight,
Some nights the stars are twinkling above,
And sometimes the heart is lonely,
And looking for love,
Sometimes in the beauty of night,
You dream of holding her,
And flying in moon's silvery light,
Filled with joy and delight,
Sometimes your heart takes flight,
And at other times you wish,
You don't wake up when you sleep tonight,
Lonely hearts and starry nights,
Part of everyone's life,
Sometimes in heartbreak,
Sometimes in delight! !
