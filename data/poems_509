MY HEART BURNS AND MELTS
My heart burns and melts with a pain and sickness
unlike this world has seen
for the tears and cries and pain and hurt of loved ones
my heart burns and melts with the ugliness which paints this world
a gloomy gray for the greed, violence, hate, and prejudice
which plaques our world
my heart burns and melts for the tired, hungry, weak, and poor

for the wars that slaughters billions and families
that are torn apart by lust and greed and jealously and hate
my heart burns and melts with a passion as strong as incense
as we live our lives in sin and vain without a care in the world
for the world we live in is cold as ice and the world is dark as pitch
for my heart burns and melts  with a passion of pain and sadness
as my heart burns and melts like ice

for my heart burns and melts for the sick and needy of the world
for the broken hearts out there who need healing
for my heart burns and melts with a passion as strong as love itself
in hoping that one day the world will a happier place
enriched in golden bliss of happiness and peace on earth
for my heart burns with a passion for a dream
that's as sweet as love itself in all its beauty
