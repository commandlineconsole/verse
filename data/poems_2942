IN SORROW
IN SORROW I GRIEVE FOR SOMEONE GREAT
IN SORROW I CANNOT REMEMBER THE FUN I HAD.
IN SORROW I NOW WALK THE LONELY STREETS
IN SORROW I NOW CAN’T BE CHEERED BY THE TREATS MY FRIENDS GAVE
IN SORROW I CAN’T SMILE AS IT TAKES ME IN MY PAST LIFE…. SOME MILES AWAY…
IN SORROW I CANNOT WIPE A TEAR ‘BECAUSE I FEAR IT MIGHT TAKE ME TO THE LONELY BEACHES I NEVER WANTED TO PASS…
BUT IN SORROW I HAVE A WISH THAT I LIVE EVERMORE IN IT…
THAN SUFFER IN IT LIFE LONG! ! !
