WHEN OPPOSING HEARTS TWEET
She loved me loved me loved till
My nectar bled dry, dry, dry to fry
She loved me loved me loved me ill
Not knowing not knowing not knowing why
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
Fate built her grave with broken stones
Her end is not a fashion trend
She could not have my bones
Decided to put hers to an end
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
I share the blame I carry the flame
My fame not by will but by reputation
I am love who killed the dame…all the same
I am hated when I just wanted healthy relation
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
Who to blame if desires are one-way street?
Did not give her or I same u-turn to breathe
Blood is wine takes a certain palate-not always neat
She used her mighty pen from the beyond to sheathe
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not  so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
Love is not bitter love is plain cruel
In the eyes of the one that did not gel
Fate chose you to love me, a dead end duel
We both died from self-inflicted hell
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not  so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
No mockingbird love to black cheery
My wish for a sweet treat gone astray
One soul restless in the grave forever tarry
The bullet that killed her did my guilt slay
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
Loving me loving me to the extreme, extreme, extreme
Made me barren afraid from love I am, I am, I am!
What fool weaves the biggest love scenes every poetic dream
Tickets to make belief no more, I’m no more a gullible fan
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
This poem does not adhere to technical rows
My garden stanzas unruly, short, long, out of control
Where are the harmonies, metric units, or tight weaved pros?
Forgive me! I am sucked deeply into depression’s black hole
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
I shelter in trinity’s blood to ease my pain
What coy, what deceit tri-words repeat give me no escape
My refrains will not wash away my permanent stain
My doomsday plaque, one-way tract to freeze my videotape
Love is not bitter love is plain cruel
In the eyes of the one that did not gel
Fate chose you to love me, a dead end duel
We both died from self-inflicted hell
Love oh love oh bitter love
Love is bitter not so sweet
Oxymoron the ultimate shove
When opposing hearts tweet!
