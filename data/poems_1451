HEARTIEST PLEASURE
We all are in this world
to do some new
to get some thing
to loose some thing
I find pleasure
in loosing something
The pleasure in poverty
is much more
If you want the natural pleasure
you give some thing
then fee
a heartiest pleasure
Certainly, the rich can not enjoy
the natural pleasure
A poor who is on starvation
gets money on the road
to fulfill his meal
imagine the pleasure of the poor.
So make the motto
of your life
only to give and give
and give only.
may be it is money
or love
or friendship
or your well behave
or your smile.
give it and get pleasure.
the heartiest pleasure
the eternal pleasure
for which
God also desires.
