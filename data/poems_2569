WE DRANK THE SADNESS
Come! !
Solitude, my friend
Accompany me tonight.
come! !
sit to my side
and bring your glass and pour in it
the sadness of solitary hearts.
Take their tears, put yours and take mine.
Let´s allow them to ferment a while
until they are converted into wine,
that tonight I want to get drunk
with the wine of sadness.
Tonight, in your company, I'll not only
drink your sadness and the sadness of world
but, rather, I´ll get drunk myself with my heart´s sadness
and the solitude of my soul.
Come solitude!
Let´s leave to walk and let´s scream to the world
that tonight we drank its sadness
and the drunkenness of the sadness
in happiness it finished! !
