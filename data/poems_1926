ANNE'S KOOKABURRA
She was lunching
outside
as is her preference
when the day is fair
Her garden is natural bush
dry and dusty
hiding bright surprises
(like purple sarsaparilla)
She didn't notice him at first
perched high up in the eucalypt next door
Till he dived
suddenly
like a raptor
and stole a morsel of chicken
from the bowl in her lap
Surprised
she watched him fly back to his branch
and whack
his prey
against it
several times
Then he lifted his magnificent cream head
and swallowed his prize
He looked down at her with
fierce intelligence
and shook
his head
from side
to side
his beak
made a loud clicking sound
intimidated
(a flash of du Maurier)
she retreated into the house
she didn't finish her lunch
