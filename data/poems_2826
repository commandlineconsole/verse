CONFIRMATION
I long to return to sadness
Which i know best
It is curious, you see- why i would
Damage my soul with earnest
Where all things strive for joy
I included - no esxception
Stand not above laws of nature
I act like other things
In sadness i feel my reality
The sad undertone of my
Hearing Feeling Tasting
Confirms my life
