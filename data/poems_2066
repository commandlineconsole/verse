LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES
Life is full of surprises
When it happens, the stars in your life either fall or will rise
One day you could be high in sky
Next day you could hit rock bottom and you wonder why
Your health your wealth your look, nothing is guarantee to you
You be surprise to find out in blink of eyes all can be taken from you
That's why if your are rich do not brag about your wealth
Because you may end up to spend all your wealth on your health
Remember there are events that's behind your control
If you believe you are fully in charge of your life, you are just a fool
Never wish to take someone else's place
Because you don't know what kind of surprises he or she will come to face
