ENNUI
Pleasure is good to hand
Where pleasure grows
Night wil not exist-
This is black and
White painting
Truth's where truth is.
Lack of connections
Networks, frames cause
My free fall through space
Yesterday  i revolved
Around myself, not caring
What others do or think
Today desperate looks
For convenience in social nests
Breeding grooming on soft couch
