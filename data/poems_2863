WHEN YOU HAVE THE BLUES
its a mericle just to see your face,
and it fills my heart with love
and faith,
but oh the sadness of lossing
you, when you have the blues.
its the good times and the bad,
and  the stuff in the middle, that
makes it what  it is,
but oh the sadness of lossing
you, when you have the blues.
