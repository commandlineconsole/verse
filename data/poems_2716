NOSTALGIA SWEET NOSTALGIA
Today I am sad!
infinitely sad,
completely lost in the sea of my sadness,
multicolored sadness that increases
with a spending of the hours.
Today I am sad!
deeply sad
completely submerged in the abyss of my melancholy.
Today the solitude, the sadness, the melancholy
and the nostalgia live inside me,
they stroll for my world,
they have invaded me with plague apocalyptic!
Who would have believed it!
I am falling in love with the nostalgia!
playful nostalgia and I flirt
with my hours of sadness.
Nostalgia of lost times and fleeting loves!
I am falling in love with the nostalgia!
Nostalgia, inseparable partner
and permanent invader of my hours of sadness!
Nostalgia, sweet nostalgia!
I want to fly with you, the principle of my memories!
I want to see you always smile with your sweet glance
old in my hours of sadness!
I am falling in love with you, sweet nostalgia!
Inseparable partner and permanent invader
of my hours of sadness,
Could you fall in love with me?
