DON'T IGNORE MY POWER
The room is melting from the heat built up
People’s bodies are blurry
A thick fog created
I can’t see the light in their eyes
.
I stand in the center alone
They are all strange to me
And their tongue is unknown
.
Cold concrete being my reflection through stone
Being my existence through liberty
Make me insignificant with a comment
Make my voice become the shallow end
.
The conversation would begin if we were both there
The words would come if we both would listen
The thoughts would redeem if you would let go
.
You’re voice is shaking with tension
Relax and reveal your true feelings
Tell me how much you hate the way things are
.
My time is not of your concern
And my concerns are not of you concern
My world is of no concern
And you seem concerned?
.
I’ll be the way I am forever
Even with all the statements you call lies
I’ll be but your forsaken moment
Cause you know you want nothing more than my lies
.
You try to make yourself more
By making me less
You try and explain your reasons
But, I turn away don’t feed me your lines
.
I’m sweet but, not innocent
I know more than most will admit
I can rip your life apart so don’t tempt me
I can make you unimportant and I hardly have to try
.
I can make your smile become still
I can make your laugh a sigh
I can take your light
.
I’m the goddess of lost dreams
I’m the queen that can destroy your being
I am the sun rise but, I’ll slice your throat
Look at me lovingly try and provoke
.
Try to touch my purity
Try and sway my delight
Pleasure my reflection
Compliments will do just fine
.
I am the shine of your wants
I am the root of your destiny
I am the seduction of your fate
.
I’ll rip you apart so don’t try and reduce me
I am a queen of my own world
But, I rule the world
Lick my lust and touch my heart lightly
.
I will only be what you tell me to be
I will only be what you see
Because you belittle me
I am only what you would call victory
