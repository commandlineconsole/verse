THE CONTENTMENT
i delight seeing the boat leave
the smoke is in our side
thick black smoke seemingly like
hands still reaching
for the abandoned land
as though it is
attached to the shore and
the old buildings
i wonder sometimes why i
delight in departures
why i at the same promise myself
that this is the only land i have
and i will be
staying  here forever
at night i am in love
too much in love to the silence of
my solitude
from here where i stand beside
this window looking at the shadow of that boat
i am happier
simplifying and filtering my thoughts
sipping the joy of the moment
i do not dream of more
i ask nothing.
