MY CUP OF JOY
No label I could trace you to,
Not an import or as a reserve,
My cup of joy,
You are unique.

Your love is a liquid that flows through me,
Continuous without ending,
A quench unsatisfied,
Always fresh and changing.

Never demanding only welcoming,
A warmth that lingers on,
My cup of joy,
You can do me no wrong.

With you my cup is always full,
Regardless of your strength and size,
It is the constant joy you bring to me,
Even words fail to describe.
