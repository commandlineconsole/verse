HER BODY LANGUAGE IS POSSESSIVE
Her body language is possessive,
as if the pleasure is aimed at herself
but still her passion is active
full of knowledge, pleasure and meaning
with the heat of her tongue, lips and mouth
that covers my whole body
everywhere over me
before she pulls me into her hot depths,
when I hear her breath quickening in passion,
when she stretches over me,
bending her body over mine
with her long hair covering my face
while she is flowering over me,
astounding me in long moments of pleasure.
