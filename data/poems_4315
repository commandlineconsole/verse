CONTRAST OF TWO EXTREMES
CONTRAST OF TWO EXTREMES
Fear kills initiatives
Hope keeps dreams alive
Fear dim todayâ€™s opportunities
Hope illuminates the future
Fear is a foe, hope is a hero
Fear despairs, hope inspires
Confusion comes with fear
Hope comes with conviction certain
What a contrast of two extremes!
Abject initiates greed
Affluence flow unending joy
Abject ignites fear, affluence raises hope
Desperation! Mother of abject
Aspiration! Father of affluence
Abject window of evils
What a contrast of two extremes
Evil born by fear nurtured by abject
It comes quick and painless
Delivering it dividend at a blink
A wind that blows no one any good
Goodness is golden!
Not easy to sow, longer it takes to germinate
Evil repulses, goodness endears
What a contrast of two extremes
Trade fear for hope, affluence for abject
And goodness for evil
