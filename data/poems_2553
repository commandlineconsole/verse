I WENT TO WHERE MY SADNESS IS
I WENT TO WHERE MY SADNESS IS
I went to where my sadness is
I named it
The naming was not enough
Nothing changed
The sadness only grew deeper and deeper
I went to where my sadness is
It no longer had a name
I tried to find it
I could not
All around me and inside me
It had become who I am
My sadness is my name
And my name now is my sadness.
