RAGING WIND
As an uninvited guest
alongside the whisperer
not minding who was there
you showed fury and anger,
you lifted and threw things
this unwanted guest,
went away with properties
and left them as trailmarks,
swept through with bulls anger
mad raging storm,
you claimed lives..
Oh! how wicked you are
a wind so cruel....
making many scream in total dismay
and running to seek solace,
don't show you face again
as many will keep running from you...
