LOVE MATTERS TO ME
Love is you
Love is me
Love is the baby we keep
Love thus, makes me weep
Love gives me patient and knows no hatred
Love helps me to say I do before the wedding bell
Love makes my head swell
'Don't you know I love you..,
Is not just a word.
So don't say it if you don't mean a word
Empty promises were not kept where there's no love
…but where there's love, all is well
Love can make your heart be loved again
Love can make you smile again and no matter how..,
…scared or not, love can make you fall in love again.
Love understands
Love gives you a hand
Love makes you dance to the rhythm of your heart without a band
Love knows all mate
Love doesn't underate
Love tolerates.., concentrates and appreciates
To be sincere, love made me do this.
Love is you
Love is me
Love is the baby we keep and it strongly matters to me
