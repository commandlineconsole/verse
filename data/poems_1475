POEME
Pleasure boat, pleasure boat
Fueled with ambergris
Whitely slide darkly;
Carrying us
Through the spit and cinder sea
So verdigris
Its rolling flatnesses
Its silvery horizons
Lining an avocado sky-
Chug onward toward the low, low
Torchon of the sun!
Pleasure boat, pleasure boat
Faint and cold blue stars
Fixed to a band of night
Joining end on end,
Hula your spar, tonight,
Whereas you nest is empty, quite;
Pteradactyl flap your dark
Peering into things
They whoop away-
Through the torchon
Of the sun chug on
To breakofday.
