[SONG] I SEE THE WANT-TO IN YOUR EYES
in tune with conway twitty song
'To See An Angel Cry'
[Oh I can see the want-to
In your eyes
Your wanting to leave me
Comes as no surprise]
You can try and hide it
But it comes as no surprise
No matter what you say
I see the want-to in your eyes
Now you say you that you love me
And I see that it's no lie
But through your tears
I see the want-to in your eyes
[Oh I can see the want-to
In your eyes
Your wanting to leave me
Comes as no surprise]
Now dear we've deen together
God knows a long long time
But no matter what
I see the want-to in your eyes
Now I don't have an idea
What brought this to your mind
But as I hold you here
I see the want-to in your eyes
[Oh I can see the want-to
In your eyes
Your wanting to leave me
Comes as no surprise]
I wish I could find a way
To simply change your mind
But honestly my dear
I see the want-to in your eyes
Oh now Heaven knows
How I'm hurting here inside
And through my pain
I see the want-to in your eyes
[repeat chorus]
[Oh I can see the want-to
In your eyes
Your wanting to leave me
Comes as no surprise]
