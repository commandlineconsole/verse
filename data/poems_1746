TWO MINUTES
Two minute`s of pleasure
for a life of misery
You want a gun now to consign
yourself to history
Alcohol clouded your judgement
your focus was a blur
She`s left you with a souvenir
of which you know there`s no known cure
Playing russian roulette with your life
was allways a big mistake
now there`s a bun in the oven
slowly starting to bake
so when it rains allways wear a hood
especially when she look`s so good
She played the field
and poisened the whole crop
with her deadly addiction
She just could`nt stop
Two minute`s of pleasure
two minute`s of sin
Reality takes hold of the mess
you find yourself in.
