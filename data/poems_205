LOVE IS MANY THINGS
Love is beautiful
Love is kind
Love is wonderful
Love is great to find
Love is not me first
Love is not, look what I’ve got
Love is not a game
Love should never be for naught
Love is warm
Love is comfort
Love is a heart aglow
Love does take effort
Love is not a sacrifice
Love is not surrender
Love should not be dismal
Regardless of your gender
Love is strength
Love is vision
Love is something
All should be given
Love is not only good times
Love is not only passion
Love should never be part time
Hopefully love will be everlasting
Love, what a beautiful word
Love sometimes is never heard
Love should never be used
Love should never be abused
