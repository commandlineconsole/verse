CONVENIENCE
It is just convenience you said frankly
What we have is just convenience
enjoy the time and make nothing out of it
It's a sad truth that I hope to change
In your body I found pleasure and relief
pleasure that questions my dignity
I tried to analyse and to justify
sadly I learnt that there is nothing more
In your coversation I see traces of guilt
Succumbing to your weakness to fight the flesh
You let the pleasures to mask your pain and
You led me into your world and I was mirroring your pain
I traveled aimlessly in this dismal place
Drifting hopelessly and I found solace  with you
When I began to hope for something more
only to discover that you brought me more pain
