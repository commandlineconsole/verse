SIEGE
Your love threw me
In the land of wonders.
It took me by surprise
From my neck
While I was
At my preferred café,
At my preferred table,
While I was teasing my poems,
While my poems were teasing me.
I forgot my preferred café
And I forgot my preferred table
I forgot my poems
I forgot whom I was teasing
And who was teasing me.
.
Your love surprised me
While I was reading my hand
For  luck
And  fate.
I forgot my hand,
I forgot my luck,
And I forgot my fate.
Your love invaded me
the same way a tsunami
Invaded the moon
In its ecliptic wedding
With the sun.
I woke up weak
Thirsty,
And thirty million light years faraway
From my birth galaxy.
I forgot the moon,
I forgot the sun,
I forgot the wedding
And I forgot my birth galaxy.
Your love surprised me
Like the Christ surprised the ancient world
I forgot Christ
And I forgot the ancient world.
