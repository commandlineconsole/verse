FEAR
Fear
It drives people
It spurs people
It hurts people
It divides people
I have known fear my whole life
Fear of otherâ€™s opinions
Fear of the future
Fear of want
Fear of failure
Fear due to being different
But I have broken the chain
No more fear
No more hesitation
No more holding back
I will live, love, laugh, and learn
All without fear
Because fear is no longer my enemy
