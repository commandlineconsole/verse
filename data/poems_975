LOVE IN MY HEART & JOY IN MY SOLE.
Today is the day
A brand new day
With love in my heart
Joy in my sole
I wake, I dance I sing with joy
Alhumdolillah I'm a muslim
Life go's on
For yesterday has died
Tomorow brings new beginings
May the love grow & the joy continue
As I grow to be who I want & need to be
A mom, A sister, A freind to all.
