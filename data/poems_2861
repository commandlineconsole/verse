*HOPELESSNESS
Sadness  -  waves and waves of sadness
Sweeping me away toward destruction
You touch me and the floodgates open
I am lost - pulled into madness
Madness  -  Never ending madness
Drowning me in pure absurdity
You look at me with eyes of pity
As I lay mired in wretchedness
Wretchedness  -  utter wretchedness
Sinking into this dark abyss
You feel me slipping from your caress
As I fall into hopelessness
Hopelessness  -  gripped by hopelessness
Knowing that I cannot be saved
You have let me slip away and fade
My soul bleeds into nothingness
