WHAT MAKES SUNSHINE?
Sunshine
fillled with love and tears
happiness and sorrow
makes the sunny sky
you ask me why tears
why sorrow
with the fading of today
into tomorrow?
tears come
when sunshine makes sorrow
so what is the sunshine you ask?
its tears of happiness
and sorrow of love
its healing pains
sent from above
your heart in two
not for heartbreak
but for tomorrow to come soon
and the sun to be shining
not the moon
