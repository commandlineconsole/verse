SANDY’S DILEMMA: DISTEMPERED EMOTIONS
her greeting was “What’s up? ”
too unfocused
lacks her raw energy
casting random
so next must come
present crisis bomb shell
another razor sharp problem
“hey I need
insight on how to move on from
my deep anger toward my girlfriend”
“hm... true that the anger is in me...
how do I make peace with my soul?
the anger is in me”
“I am sick and tired
of understanding their needs and desperations
and tired of embracing her pains”
no reply she’s
tearing off butterfly wings
again with distempered emotions
