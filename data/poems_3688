CARING?
Stop sitting there pretending
like you care
pretending
i want to care
but how do i care
for the careless
How do you pretend to care?
That you want me to care?
Do you want me to care?
When you don't even care
Should we care?
For our carelessness?
Why don't we care enough to care?
I suppose we could all care
But if we all cared
Would it matter?
Forget it i don't care...
