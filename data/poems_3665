FRIENDS FOREVER
I don't care if you can't cheer me up
I care that you try anyway
I don't care if you don't know what to say
I that your there for me
I don't care if you can't stop the pain
I care that you stand by my side no matter what
I don't care if you can't help me
I care that you care enough to stick around
I don't care if your not perfect
I care that your you
because to me you are perfect
