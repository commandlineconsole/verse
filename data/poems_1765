FANCY
All beauty lies within
And gives from its pleasures
All of its tender kin
Are of this earth treasures
They open up the sky
To gives us joy awhile
And bring us further high
Sometimes have a smile
Let nothing break apart
What love might give or do
It comes all from the heart
And then it is up to you
Whatever you will make
And what will then go on
From pleasures you can ace
If some not rightly are done
Sing and sing your way
To where each touch belong
Mornings come bright or gray
In each and every song
There are some moments still
With everything you need
Carry and dreams up fill
If fancy from them you read
