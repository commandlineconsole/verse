GROWING UP
Unknown to life
The cries echoing to dreams untold
Yet beauty reflected the loving care
Casting the bond to be shared Fulfilling lifes creations
Such care brought a smile
Telling the world of the beauty
Beyond ones loving care Soon that care brought cries of
reality
Proving a purpose beyond ones dreams
That life gave warning for all to see Counting the days, the years as
they went by
Reaching ones ambitions untold
So that life unknown
Gave happiness for all the world
to know.
