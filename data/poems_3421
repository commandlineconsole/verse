WHOM MAY CONCERN/SUICIDE NOTE
I'm writing this lyrics with a numb mind
pretty much i just found out
that my life is waste of time.
Whom may concern?
This pain that i feel inside can
somebody take  it away?
I ask god but he didn't answer me back.
I'm trying to make the world  to understand me
but i just  don't know how to spell the right words
to understand the world in a different way.
So those who may concern about this crazy man that is me,
I'm saying good bye and I'm just going to sleep deep tonight.
I want everybody to don't forget about my poems because
that is my life trought words for those
who may concern.
