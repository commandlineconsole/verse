IN THE DARKNESS
In the darkness, my mind shatters in despair
With this sadness, I weep but shed not a tear
I feel helpless, can my soul find repair
Is it senseless, to still talk with no one there
In the darkness, evil lurks behind my stare
With this sadness, it beckons me to its lair
I feel helpless, can I beat the evil here
Is it senseless, to fight the pain that I bare
In the darkness, evil leaves and so does fear
Itâ€™s not senseless, for the Lord holds me dear
