SAD SAD SORROW
The crow sits there
Atop a willow branch
Singing the sad sad song
Of sorrow
Warning you
The end is near
You dismiss the thought
And cover your ears
From the retched cawing
Of the crow
It follows you
Where ever you go
It's a burden
On your shoulder's low
You try to understand
What the crow means
You're sitting on your bed
And you hear
A distant tapping
On your window
The crow
You see it crying
Tears of a dark angel
You jump back
Startled
And try to catch your breath
You go to the window
But the crow's gone
And you begin to feel
All alone
You look down
And see one of its feathers
With its dark magic
And mystic wonder
You roll it over
Between your fingertips
And hear it singing
The song
Of sad sad sorrow
You piece together the puzzle
Tears of an angel
Feathers of dark magic
And the sad sad sorrow song
It's the end
The end is near
The day the crow left
So did you
And now all you hear
Is the song of
Sad sad sorrow
