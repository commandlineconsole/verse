YOUR SHINING EYES
As I look through those shining eyes,
I see hurt,
Pain,
Sorrow,
And I,
I try to clam you in the night,
During rain's fall,
Peacefully while you sleep,
And I,
I try to understand,
Why those tears keep falling,
For I,
I cry to,
Waiting for your return,
So I can once again be in your arms,
So tell me once more,
Why these tears fall,
Because even I know,
Laughing,
Eventually laughs into a hollow cry,
My dear,
Don't cry,
Because I,
I am right here,
Right by your side,
Catching each tear that falls,
Falls in sorrow,
As your shining eyes show me,
Hurt,
Pain,
Sorrow.
