I CAME, I SAW, WHO CONQUERED?
Music sudden waved Time's blight,
An incarnation of delight
Unchallenged. Naught continued to
Deny bright beauty, spirit true.
Each blush rose paled,  blood ruby too.
Magnificence expelling night,
Acknowledged inner thirst quenched through
Unequalled charm, dream beamed delight
DEfying definitions trite.
Magical our planet blue
Appears to Nature, taps into
Unsullied streams of rainbow hue.
Descriptions fail. These splendours span
Eternities unguessed by man.
