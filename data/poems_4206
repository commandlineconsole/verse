OUT OF RUMOR OUT OF FEAR
Most dangerous is fear.
Fear not and tight the knot.
Rumors may occur and
You are not here to trigger.
Be clear fear most danger.
Fear is tumor
Uproot it from beginning
And enjoy life number.
O my God
You are here
Why should I fear
I am with you always
Keep me with you
Keep me from
Out of rumor
Keep me from
Out of fear

With this gear.
