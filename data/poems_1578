OF PLEASURE AND PAIN
The sense of pleasure
Feeds off the sensual
What we see, hear, taste, touch and smell
The fantastic reaction these external-internal stimuli trigger
Firing off when we see someone or something that excites us
We all live, sensitive in varying degrees, to pleasure and pain
What if you found, the balance thrown askew
Your sensitivity to pleasure and pain grown manifold
And you're living a sensory overdrive
The sense of pleasure is extreme
So is the sense of pain
Throbbing waves of silent agony surround
Smiling faces that mask great pain
Pleasant conversations papering over agonised hearts
Joie de vivre glossing over loneliness
Aching bodies pumped up for action on steroids
All hitting a painful hollow at the core
When the body slumps and the soul tires
Of faking life, what then?
What if you felt this goddess of pain
As acutely as the sensual mistress?
