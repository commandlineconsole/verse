JOY
Stimulated to motivate,
With an appreciation of it.
Eliminates resistance,
And the fearing of risks.
With,
Benefits to claim.
And with,
Benefits named.
Anticipating debating,
Is not the same.
When one is occupied,
With choices wished to gain.
With,
Benefits to claim.
And with,
Benefits named.
There's a reason one seeks hope and joy.
To rid of a nothingness,
That annoys.
There's a reason one seeks hope and joy.
To rid of a nothingness,
And wanting to know happiness.
Even if a little bit,
People want to pocket some joy.
As if a new toy.
And always theirs...
Never to be destroyed.

Joy, joy...
Always there,
To employ.
Even if a little bit,
People want to pocket some joy.
