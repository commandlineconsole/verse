WE – NOT WE
My joy and your joy don’t go together,
My thoughts and your thoughts touch slightly.
My hand, your hand – they will meet never,
My dreams want to kiss your dreams lightly.
Your words bloom in my heart like flowers,
I’d like to pick them and not to suffer any longer.
There is my heart and yours in the scattered showers,
My love and my hope - I have to smother them.
My island is so lonely; my flag waves on the pole.
You should have it at heart and come to comfort.
But I had a look around and didn’t see a soul.
Your ship can’t still find the inaccessible port.
My joy and your joy don’t go together,
My thoughts and your thoughts touch slightly.
My hand, your hand – they will meet never,
My dreams want to kiss your dreams lightly.
