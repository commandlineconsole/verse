HALF A POEM
I laughed. The other option was to cry,
But she was looking so I had to laugh
Or show myself as weak - I cried inside,
Where only I could see my many tears
That poured like fountains of my sorrow,
My joy, my pain, my peace, my hate, my love.
I thought she was the pinnacle of love:
A flower that comforts the ones who cry,
A beam of light that ends the worst sorrow,
A joy that causes chuckle then a laugh
That then explodes and ends with lovely tears.
This girl, she made me feel these things inside.
I never told her what I felt inside
My silly dreams of life with her in love
With me, I thought one kiss would seal the tears
Which spread throughout a heart that bled to cry,
Recalling not the day of sharing laugh-
ter: friends became a mist in the sorrow.
And there was my downfall- in my sorrow
