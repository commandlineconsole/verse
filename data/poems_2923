VIBES OF SORROW
Soaring high,
Being wild
Seeking for,
A vibes that rhymes
List of pains,
A print of words
Squiggle in grey,
That kills it prey
Vibes of sorrow,
Wander in miles
Glides as thereâ€™s no tomorrow,
Bouncing sentiments flies
A plopping misery,
Ripples its calm intuition
Ripping kardia slowly,
Ventricles shutters in confusion
Vibes of sorrow,
Roving aimlessly in hiatal
A notion felt shallow,
Lost in recondite hovel
As it demarche,
Vibes of sorrow
Auger till gaunt,
Smidgen of morsels dwell
Vibes of sorrow,
Wail with mourn
Resuscitate the tears,
Amidst surging fulminant
Such intense substance,
Unable to forestall
Acquiescently embrace,
The vibes of sorrow
