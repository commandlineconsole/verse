IF IT RAINS, WHO CARES
If it rains who cares, if it rains
If it rains who cares, if it rains
If it rains who cares, if it rains
If it rains who cares
Sit down and listen to the music of the wind
Sit down and listen to the joy that it brings
The falling of the rain, thunder in the sky
Nature plays her symphony as my mind begins to fly
Ten million stampeding raindrops thrash, like horses in the street
As colors that make up the world, lie silently and unafraid
Of the wait that crushes them, whispering words that gently say
They’re dying, but they don’t die, they only fade
The animals lay there heads and listen to her tune
As the trees add the harmonies beneath an autumn moon
Aristocrat clouds crowd the balconies adding atmosphere to the scene
The waves are breaking on the shore, as seashells silently record everything
Everywhere are waterfalls, roaring as they hit the ground
Such an impressive sight to see, a dropp or two fall in clear blue water
Flowers spread their robes to catch the gentle kisses of the rain
Licking their lips with sensual care, no body sees, so their sensuality doesn't matter
break
The water flowing in the street, will pass into the bay
To solo natures symphony for yet another day
And when the curtains draw, the birds will begin to sing
To encore nature symphony to the music of the wind
But if it rains who cares
If it rains who cares
If it rains who cares
If it rains who cares
