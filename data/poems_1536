UNFORTUNATE MAN
Unfortunate man
No lamp burns
As the lamp  of  love
No cloud rains
As the cloud of love
No water flows
As  the water  of love
No wind blows
As the wind of love
No pleasure is more
Than the pleasure of giving
No return is more golden
Than   the return of love
But he who does not know
How to dissolve
Surely he is an unfortunate man.
He who believes in taking only
Surely he is a miser man
How does he know,
What is the pleasure in dismantlement?
