RONDEL III
Founts of tears, and rivers of sadness,
Streams of grief, seas full bitter again,
Surround me still, drowning in deep pain
My poor heart that suffers such great distress.
So am I sunk deep drowned in harshness:
Over me flow more powerful than the Seine
Founts of tears, and rivers of sadness.
Their great waves breaking, a vast largess,
As the winds of Fortune heave and strain,
I beneath, so deep that to rise again
Is hard, so heavy their loads oppress,
Founts of tears, and rivers of sadness.
