THE BEAUTY OF SORROW
I drink from the cup of sorrow
I ate the delicious bread of hope
that sorrow placed in front of me
It craves my heart day and night
Not telling me how to climb the height
The height that is pulling my heart too tight
The height that tells me not to be frighten
But what helps me out is the beauty of sorrow
The drink it place in front of me makes me calm
Though, it's bitter and sour
But when it does, it feels cold like a plate of ham
Total humbleness pull me through
Total submission to what to come
Sorrow gives me hope
Those are the best dayz in my life
Sorrow dayz
