*.* SWEETLY, IN THEIR EMBRACE
Glisten-ning reflections of early spring’s love
Mirrors dream-y sky’s tadpoles dancing above
Speckled fair - haired crocus line dew-pond’s edge
Starry young green eyes gaze up in delight
Attentive blue devotion reaches heart
Strong fingers entwine love’s laced white gloves
Light feet step, one step left and turn and twirl
Petal-ed gowns breeze sweetly in their embrace
Coat-tails virile a handsome prince-presence
Delight-fully encircle God-given-ed graces
