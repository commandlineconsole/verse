FORGET ABOUT ME
in this life others confide in me
no problems of mine have any importance you see
so go on your way, the world will never notice at all
have a great life, go have yourself a bal
see, when i'm gone, only a few will really care
so don't worry yourself about the when and wher
the ones i truly care about, don't really care about me
so when i'm gone, some will feel more free
see, i was the bad guy for a long, long time
but i paid my debts to society with hard time
thats all that anyone remembers, not anything good
like i really care if they ever would
