GOD'S CARD
Never be tired to work hard
For life is a pre-written card
Where joys and sorrows come
To make your day and there sum
The blessings that is given to you
That gives you joy that is true
And that's why its important dear
To learn to handle and take care
Of the joys and work hard
For life is god's pre-written card.
