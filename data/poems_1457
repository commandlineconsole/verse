OVER INDULGENCE
Whisked away in a summers wind
Flying higher, still higher than any cloud before
Now falling, falling gracefully
Falling in front of Pleasures door
As opened with the gentlest touch
Warm air, sweet and fruitful
Swarms and pulls
It comes and consumes you in a rush
Lush vegetation all around
Fruit rains from trees, bushes, and vines
These who gather are from a licentious dream
Sporting all their goods they could bear
Hauled in by opened grasping hands
Soft as silk, warm as blankets
Inviting were all the gripping bands
They pulled harder and the doors closed
Lost in the amorous world
Dancing, music, laughter in the day
The sharing of bed and body at night
Lost in it all; their, they're Tender Kisses!
'Lost, lost in the deranged world
Time is routine, done by 12
Struck, as with Calypso
Shall seven years be my time'?
Pleasure is pleasure as pleasure be done
Gluttony of pleasure, breaker of chastity
Sinned, loss of purity amongst many
Sinned, of no restraint; release and forgive
'Pleasures door has opened, if by my prayer
Sea salt and cold wind is before me there
Leaping through the door, gaining my last chance ever
I watch the people to envy sleep forever
As Pleasure closes it's door.'
