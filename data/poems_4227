FEARED REPUBLIC
Nation is thrilled and filled,
Celebrating January 26,2010.
Viewing the labored faces in the idiot box,
I am brooding,
What we have achieved?
What we have lost?
Is it only a talked republic and
Much cherished constitution?
I want to introspect,
What is it that makes my nation weak?
Why million cries beat my heart day round
And make me feared abound.
Fear of rising index of crime and corruption,
Fear of soaring prices and empty bellies,
Fear of unholy nights and bloody days,
Fear of endless wait for justice,
Fear of chair deals by corrupt mohanics coalitions,
Fear of blast and mines,
Fear of blood thirsty Maowadis and Jihadis,
Fear of intruders welcomed without visas,
Fear of cross border enemies nourished as friends,
Fear of valued slaughter goats and unvalued girls,
Fear of despair in abundance,
Fear of banishment of hope and peace,
Fear why I love my dear sick nation?
Where merit is crushed and dreams shattered.
I am done with these fears.
My leaders secular ask me
To throw the fear and love out.
Then I cherished a dream inside,
Some one wakes us up,
Some who will make nation proud
And take the nation on cloud ninth,
Someone will act and heel our wounded world,
And not to wait for the dried flowers and devastated dreams,
To bloom in the next world.
