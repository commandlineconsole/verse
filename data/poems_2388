CHARMED
Carve thy name into my heart,
in stead of stressed i lay here charmed
Charmed by the anger in my heart,
But the charm is coming undone
As thy carves in my heart with a bloody knife
Showing no mercy
Leaving open wounds bleeding profusely,
Wounds shown to the world
In this living black hell i see your eyes,
and the light flashing in them
Your blue tears mixing with my black tears healing me,
the charm of anger coming undone
taking part of me with it,
my anger at you and the blood i lost to you
So go on i will not shriek in pian,
carve anything in my bleeding heart
I shall only cry mixing my black no,
now my blue tears with yours
healing my bloody heart leting,
out the anger thats been charmed in me
