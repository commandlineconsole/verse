DON'T FEAR THE DREAM
Don't fear the dream, children, as I once did
Don't fear the dream in the stillness of night
Follow that call, given in the darkness
For it will lead you into that bright light
Don't fear the emotions that well within
Don't fear the emotions as the tears fall
Follow your conscience, speaking deep inside
For life with no heart, is no life at all
Don't fear the power that you've been given
Don't fear the power when your moment comes
Follow the Giver who gives you your strength
For there's reason you are who you've become
Don't fear the dream, so bold, as I once did
Don't fear the dream or the visions by night
Follow that call, as given by your King
For reward awaits those who fear, yet fight
And, even when your struggle seems hopeless
And, even when your heart begins to fail
Don't fear the impending evil ahead
For if He is with you, you will prevail
