DREADFUL TEARS
Rolling down from eyes tears,
Twisted with sorrow and bliss,
Hunt words to words to kiss,
Lines to lines to create verse,
Heart gently transposes tears to eyes,
And melting sorrow and bliss like an ice,
Crystal transparent tears in eyes screen,
Betwixt sorrow and bliss shed, fade tears
Tears shares and contribute an hour…
When ever sorrow and bliss occur …
Innocent heart showers, emotion tears,
Departing and meeting tale, tears bears
Tears true friend of loneliness, never withers,
When ever there is pain and bliss always shares,
Tears inside eyes with emotion thread weave…
Delicate and tender, fragile like spider web
