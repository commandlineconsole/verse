PLEASURE OF BEING
The heart of JOy
the soul of an Action
the result of a fusion
its pleasure-the expression of a mission
in conclusion
it is a pleasure to live
when a loved one attends
to your needs
and shares your heeds
and places you at the top of deeds
it is pleasure to sweep the dust
all over the earth
if you will tread
my path with your finest lead
if my baby will drink all milk
I shall suckle her
till my breasts shall bear
no more living sacks
and just a dot of darkness marks
it is a pleasure
to design a mansion of measure
just to house my world of loves
Leisure seeks pleasure
pleasure looks after leisure
green is grass' pleasure
softness is petal's pleasure
cool is the snowball's pleasure
cooing is cuckoo's pleasure
Relax, swimming in the life
dive up and down to inhale the joy
of forgetting self
submitting to the pleasure of being nothing.
