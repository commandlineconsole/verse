"LOVE'S DELIGHT"
Singing to my heart's delight
For I have no words to write
At the top of my voice
For all to hear
This is I, I am not shy
At least this is what they may think
I don't really care!
For my soul's delight
I sing of love and joy
Millions of miles across the sea
You lie in bed fast asleep
My song reaching you, a lullaby
Waking you gently with the same smile
Playing around my lips
Surrounding you with my love
Your heart beating fast for sensing me near
