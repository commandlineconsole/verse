WHY IS THERE SUCH SADNESS IN THE WORLD?
WHY IS THERE SUCH SADNESS IN THE WORLD?
Why is there such sadness in the world?
Why is there so much sadness in me?
Twilight is sad its true
But I just wished Happy New Year
To a man who will probably die this year
I am just an old fool
With so many fears
But the Sadness
And its causes
Are real too much-
