LOVE'S JEWEL IS EASY TO FIND
Love is a friend inside your heart
Love's a wonder the start,
A pleasure to give
Love is to believe,
The way to live
Love is not for those
Who love to hate,
Love is beauty as is a rose
Love opens heaven's gate,
Love opens many doors
Love from the heart and it's yours
Love's jewel is easy to find,
Love's the soother of the mind.
Love is riches for the kind
Love is for lovers who often fight
Love will always hold them tight,
If you think you've been left out
God will always love you there is no doubt.
