ANGER
In anger, you can break a flower
vase or something precious,
Just think, can you get it back
After it moves on to another brain?
Anger is the devil that
blows the glow of the mind,
You do something drastic
leaving your sense behind.
Later, you will repent for
what you have done,
While the devil happily
dances for having won.
So next time you get anger,
Just think what had happened
last time,
And what you had achieved or
rather lost by it.
Then you will realise the true
worth of your anger.
If you can ignore and leave
it behind,
It will become an unwelcome
guest in your mind.
