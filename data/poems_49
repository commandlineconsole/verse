LOVE IS MY BELIEVES
Love is eyeless
Love is observed
Love is bitter
Love is nasty
Love is precaution
Love is disinclination
Love is naked
Love is ultimatum
Love is reconciliation
Love is forceful
Love is perfect
Love is cloudy
Love is bulbous
Love is taint
Love is dreamland
Love is perdition
Love is rolling
Love is gummy
Love is precarious
Love is storybook
Love is breakable
Love is flexible
Love is gifted
Love is tense
Love is guiltless
Love is top
Love is poorest
Love is naught
But love is the whole thing
Love is divinity
Love is sprite
Love is evil
Love is outstanding sun
Love is broken moon
Love is gorgeous earth
Love is the foulest worm of earth
Love is down
Love is disturbing
But love is delightful and love is aching strong
Love is alike
Love is moreover
