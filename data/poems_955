FOR THE BEST
I wish you my dear
Very best in everything
Where only joy comes
The joy of the spring
Where flowers bloom and
Spread its bright light
And make pleasing
Your every sight
And I wish it all for you
Because I love and care
And want with you forever
All life's joy to share
And begin a wonderful life
With lots ofhopes and wishes
In our minds and hearts
Under god's loving shades and bliss.
