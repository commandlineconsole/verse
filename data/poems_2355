'DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN'
Don't let the sun go down on anger,
For its' darkness will never fade.
Anger eats at the Soul of man,
And sends us early graves.
God's Mercy and Love, shall set one free,
From the bonds of angers wrath.
Taking the scars of all mankind,
Placed in God's hand,  for Him to graft.
Don't let the sun go down,
While the daylights still in view.
Forgive your fellow-man their sins,
And letting you sleep anew.
