LOVE HURTS
Love hurts,
When you can't be with the one you love,
Love hurts,
When the one you love is with someone else,
Love hurts,
When the one you love doesn't feel the way you feel,
Love hurts,
When you don't want anyone else but the one you love,
Love hurts,
When you know you are better than the person they're with,
Love hurts,
When you see the person is with someone who really doesn't love them,
Love hurts,
When all you can do is watch the one you love get hurt,
Love Really Hurts
