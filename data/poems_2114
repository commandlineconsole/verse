LAS VEGAS
Been to Las Vegas
Couldn’t believe my eyes
Searing heat and slot machines
Took me by surprise.
Oh, I knew that they would be there
Nothing more safe to say,
But that I could touch and feel them
Took my breath away.
Right at this very moment
Ten thousand machines at play
Neon lights flashing brightly
In the middle of the day
I feel so very humble
That I had the chance
To walk along the Sunset Strip
Watch rainbow waters dance.
An unforgettable experience
I wish I could repeat.
To step out there just one more time
Along that amazing street.
Do people really live there?
That city of renown.
While I am safely back at home
In an English seaside town.
Been to Las Vegas
Couldn’t believe my eyes
Searing heat and slot machines
Took me by surprise.
