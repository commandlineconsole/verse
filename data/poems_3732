OF ME-WHO CARES? ?
Who cares about my likes
I'm just misunderstood
who cares about my dislikes
If I could vanish-then I would
Who cares of my existance
you wouldn't mind if I...disappeared?
I try to be happy
but that only results to tears
I tell the ones I care for
not to think of self elimination
Yet I do so myself
and still will have life determination
Who really cares of me
don't force yourself to care
If you don't then its fine cuz I understand
soon I'll be out of your life
and elsewhere
