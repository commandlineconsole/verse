FROM LOOKS SPRANG LOVE
First the eyes meet
Then you can't stop yourself meeting
Meetings leads to sharing
And sharing leads to caring
Caring is out of deep concern
And concern out of intense care,
And it leads to consolation.
All these happens when eyes meet.
The eyes meet, they meet because
They are destined to meet
It may lead to fall or rise of a person
But they do operate in reaction.
So eyes meet and heart leads itself to destiny.
Whether it meets for good or bad
Unknowingly, it is destined,
Predetermined as a holy encounter.
