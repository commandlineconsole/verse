CARE. WITH IT DONE TO DO
Care.
About something.
Care.
With it done to do.
Care.
Without expecting,
Something back to get...
Just to let it shown,
You've done a caring.
And you want it known.
Care.
With it done to do.
Without expecting,
Something back to get...
Just to let it shown,
You did a caring.
And you want it known.
