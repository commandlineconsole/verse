THE TREASURE
I saw a treasure
Along the shore
Nobody had ever seen it
Not even a single bit
This treasure is not that important
'Cuz it does not give us the whole triumphant
Money, Gold and many more
Sadness will never cure
I realized that I already found the treasure
And sadness will cure
This treasure is so true
And this is going to be a 'Friend Like You! '.
