WHO CARES?
Who Cares
Who Cares
Who cares about the wind that blows
the tide that flows
or a child that grows
who cares
who cares
who cares about running in the sand
a reaching hand
or a bent old man
who cares
who cares
what will it take to relize
that you only learn to care
when you open your eyes
and be there
who cares about the world today
so many people rushing so many ways
who cares
who cares
who cares
i care
