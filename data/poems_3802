BURNING
I cry
deep inside
does no one hear me?
I burn
deep inside
does no one see me?
I'm cold
deep inside
does no one feel me?
I sleep
deep inside
does no one care?
Does no one care
I can't take it anymore?
Does no one care
I want
to end it all
Right now?
Does no one care
at all?
I scream
deep inside
does no one hear me?
I'm flames
deep inside
does no one see me?
I'm ice
deep inside
does no one feel me?
I'm (dead)
deep inside
does no one care?
Does no one care
I can't take it anymore?
Does no one care
I want
to end it all
Right now?
Does no one care
at all?
