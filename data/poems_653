DON'T TELL ME
Oh my Husband,
my Man
my eastern Man
my arabMan,
my Lionking
tell me who teached you
to make love?
who teached you how
to give this pleasure,
make me moan, scream, shout, cry
for passion given by your skill
of making love.
My Man, please do never tell me that,
please do never answer me,
even i may ask when jealousy turns upon me.
Please my Man,
let me have my dream of that
this was new for you too, this
passion which we found
into each others bodies
and touch.
