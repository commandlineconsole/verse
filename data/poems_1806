YOU AND THE FLOWER
you will have a hard time seeing
the pain
of the flowers in the xylem
for
you are always
preoccupied savoring
the pleasures
of your senses to the
majesty of its
petals
the flowers have this
message
for
you
better not taste the bitter
fluids
running within its
system
you take pleasure
and the flower understands this
you too
have all the bitterness
within you
which the flower
has read
in the labyrinths of
your genes
for
it was here before you
come and
then begin to
smell
the scent of its
temporariness
its
secret you
shall not
fathom
