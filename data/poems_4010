SHE SAYS SHE CARES
She forged me a smile
then she tore it off
she says she cares for me
so why doesn't she act it
she just dumped me off to go
somewhere where she doesn't know
she just dumped me but doesn't know
shes running somewhere she doesn't know
She was my sunshine
my only delight
I would have done it all
She never asked
she just dumped me off to go
somewhere where she doesn't know
she just dumped me but doesn't know
shes running somewhere she doesn't know
so here I stay in this pit of dismay
taunted by her hope and stuck alone to cope
paralized in time, wasn't very kind
she thinks she still cares yet she didn't try to know
how to care, she doesn't care, care for me, she doesn't care
I feel used by her
but know I wasn't
I feel deceived
and still do
she just dumped me off to go
somewhere where she doesn't know
she just dumped me but doesn't know
shes running somewhere she doesn't know
Now I carry another
slash on my heart
a bleeding love
lost to the world
