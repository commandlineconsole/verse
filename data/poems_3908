ONCE I KNEW
Once I knew,
Knew you loved me,
Knew I was yours,
Knew that I belonged,
But now?
I don't understand what happened,
Don't understand what went wrong,
I don't quite know how to say it,
But I don't really love you anymore,
I know you must think that I'm joking,
That I don't understand what it means,
But I don't really care for your temper,
Don't really care for your needs,
I always thought that we'd be,
Always thought you'd be there,
BUt I don't care...
I can't care,
I just don't know anymore.
