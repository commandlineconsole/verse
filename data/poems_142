LOVE
I love mom dad brothers sisters
I love uncles aunts cousins nieces nephews
I love friends
I love you
I love everybody
I love milk with cookies and choclate cake
I love my dogs, even the bugs, some they bit me
I love to travel
When i was young i love to play hide and seek
I love to run for fun
I love to swim
I love being outside in the cool breeze of mountain air
I love to drive
I love to smile, and to see yours
I love the water
I love the mountains
I love God
I love to see God in you all
