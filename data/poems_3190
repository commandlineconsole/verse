WAIT TILL TOMORROW
Don't feel blue
If sorrows meet you
For sorrows and joys
Are like life's toys
With which all play
In land and in clay
So just have some hope
And now learn to cope
And know in life
Happiness do survive
But its path is narrow
So just wait till tomorrow
When sun will shine bright
And everything will be right
And then you'll feel glad
As things won't be any more bad.
