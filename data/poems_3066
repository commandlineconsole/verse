TIME IS FAST
Time is fast and yet so vast
And life is but a sorrow strife like wake
The feeling hurt of sorrows state
That bellows and plunders of deepest thought
When life is done on that demon plate
And our mind dithers and falls too short
And pain an sorrow will wither by
And burn us up like burning sun
When all we need is that infant Womb
That follows and hollows in menace tone
And gives no peace within that Tomb.
