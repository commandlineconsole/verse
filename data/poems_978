MY SOUL
Tears flow from my eyes
Words are useless now
No more smiles
No more joy
The only thing left of me is darkness
It consumes my heart
My soul
and my mind
With a flick of the wrist every thing fades to black
There is just too much pain
Nostalgia
Sorrow
Hatred
With the thought of my destruction always in the back of my mind
It constantly eating away the back of my mind
Stripping my soul of happiness
And all nor should
I say any joy I'll ever have
To know what I long will never come
What little joy I once had is gone and never will return
I look into my future all I see is darkness.
