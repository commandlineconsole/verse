THE SECRET SORROWS OF THOSE WHO DO NOT SLEEP
Oh the secret sorrows of those who dare not sleep
Reliving all their sorrows in dark of night
Over truths unspoken, oh how they weep
As the deep dark overtakes their sight
Oh the secret sorrows of those who dare not sleep
Every night how they relive those ancient pains
Into the heart of darkness, delving ever deep
Feeling every wound, again, and again
Oh the secret sorrows of those who dare not sleep
For in dreams the pain lives on, and on
Whispering in the dark so private, of the secrets they keep
Hidden from revealing light of breaking dawn
Oh the secret sorrows of those who dare not sleep
Oh the secret sorrows and ancient scars
Oh the endless dreamers in the dark so deep
Whose secrets are kept by moon and stars
