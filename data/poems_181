I LOVE YOU MORE.
I love you more than Winter snow
I love you more than early Spring
I love you more than Summer's glow
I love you more than anything
I love you more than Autumn leaves
I love you more than Birds on high
I love you more than Christmas carols
I love you more than Years gone by
I love you more than the Bluest sky
I love you more than falling Rain
I love you more with every Day
I love you more than I can Say
I love you more than Josh's looks
I love you more than reading Books
I love you more than 'Seve's swing'
I love you more than anything
