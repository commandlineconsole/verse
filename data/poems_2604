SINKING DEEPER
Just don't leave me here alone
sinking deeper into this sadness
drowning in this sorrow
wave after wave-of misery
Going down-for the last time
sinking deeper into this sadness
deeper than this heart can take
wave after wave-of misery
Take me gently in your arms
hold me safe-away from harm
Keep this heart from breaking
whisper softly
tell me-I will be alright
'montional storm rising up
moments now-tattered and torn
trying hard-keep control
Feeling empty
the coldness-is unwanted here
Just don't leave me here alone
sinking deeper into this sadness
drowning in this sorrow
wave after wave-of misery
Going down-for the last time
sinking deeper into this sadness
deeper than this heart can take
wave after wave-of misery
Fall apart
from inside-out
Let me know
wasn't in vain
how do I tell-reason
To be assured
that given-wasn't total waste
Just don't leave me here alone
sinking deeper into this sadness
drowning in this sorrow
wave after wave-of misery
Going down-for the last time
sinking deeper into this sadness
deeper than this heart can take
wave after wave-of misery...
