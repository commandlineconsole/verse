AN ANGEL
'An Angel'
Sneaked
In
My dreams,
Last night an
Angel...had no wings,
Halo to claim divinity.
I saw myself passing through dark woods...quiet and serene.
But, now this silence troubled me a lot, instilled in me fear and awe.
Just then an angel came by,
Holding my hands,
Looked back into my eyes,
Embracing me closer, guided me out,
Dark woods did not concern me now.
Fear, awe, concern receded,
Restored was calmness, peace,
Happiness, trust,
And an understanding of love...
...But then the angel soon receded,
And I woke up startled,
As if he thrusting me in the real world,
To find him.
