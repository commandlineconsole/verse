VARANDA
Siting outside in the varanda
I am enjoying the summer in Brazil
The passion fruit tree is blooming
The bloom of the passion tree is colorful
It is amazing to see it
The palm trees are tall
I can see it
This is a tropical country
This hot weather is beautiful
I could have it all
Year around if I lived in Brazil
But I don't
I live in Canada
