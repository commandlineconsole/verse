I BACKED AWAY
“Who brought you home? ”
I backed away slightly,
Forming a smile upon my face.
The liars and criminals outside,
I introduced myself as a partner,
An accomplice and bothersome critic.
Looking back, my mind took a strange
Idea, and began to bark and cry
For the fear generated in my mother,
The fear of answers and questions,
The fear of lies and hard-suffering,
And the fears behind the fears.
My mind has transgressed with my soul,
And I am weak now as ever before.
