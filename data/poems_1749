LIFE'S PLAN
When you are sick with worries
And for yourself you feel sorry
Then know oh dear man
Life doesn't come with a plan
So you have to learn to deal
And from life you have to steal
A part of fain and pleasure
For this is life's great treasure
that help in ups and downs
When you're stuck with frown
So try to contribute to fun
Before life's days are done
And know of dear man
Life doesn't come with a plan
So you have to learn to deal
And from life you have to steal
A part of fain and pleasure
For this life is a great treasure.
