AFTER SHOCK
The pain just left,
When the blue sky rolls in,
The horizon turns visible,
And the sadness begins,
Eyes can deceive,
But I fret they don’t now,
The myths are behind us,
We hear the truth loud,
The black tumbles out,
Leaving radiant blue in the skies,
I hate this the most,
It’s teasing our eyes,
What some say is the storm
I say is the first page,
The pages to come is the real sadness and rage,
Sadness for people who
Lost,
Lost,
And lost,
For families,
Strangers,
Wanders,
Wishers,
Dreamers,
Hopers,
Now we all must be believers,
Believe we’ll get up and master the sky,
We’ll stand up and wash up and open our eyes,
We can loose the sadness and rage,
But we’ll never loose the scars that the after shock gave
