CAN I TELL YOU MY DEEPEST FEAR?
What is my deepest fear?
My deepest fear is that I am to shy at first to gain mt y own trust
Can I tell you my deepest fear?
Can I really tell you my deepest fear?
When I said that my deepest fear is that I am to shy at first to gain my own trust.
That was a lie.
If I tell you my deepest fear promise me that you will not say anything to anybody?
My deepest is that I am too high standard to notice anything else about myself.
Do I know anything else about myself you ask.
Of course I do
I don't want to sound to self-centered
But I do have to say that I am smart.
Enough  about me, I have a quesion for you
What is your deepest fear?
