A GLIMPSE OF SPRING
Now the spring comes with all its delight,
The plants are laden with colourful blossoms,
White, yellow, purple, blue, and red,
There intoxicating fragrance  enthralls the mind
It seems somebody has opened the doors of Paradise
The earth is clad in green cloak
The sky watches her with delight
The birds sing  pleasant notes
The bees buz round the flowers
To suck their juice
The butterflies  fly with glee
Waiting for their turn
A fine breeze  blows muttering the words of affection
The rivulet  dance with joy and rapture
The hills, the valleys, and the cascades
All wear a new and beautiful look
The whole atmosphere is filled with rapture and I too.
