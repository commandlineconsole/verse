TODAY... 'BUNDLE OF MYRRH '
An endless source of delight and comfort is He
a Bundle of Myrrh is my belov√®d to me.
Great love and affection upon me He bestows
all sweetness and tenderness my Lord Jesus shows.

Clasped to His bosom as we rest all through the night
near to His heart and in the warmth of His delight.
Whispering sweet words of love as His eyes meet mine
lost in deep ecstasy with Jesus the Divine
