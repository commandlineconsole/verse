FEAR IS MY DESTINY
Fear and pain
are two factors
that make up my fear.
But what you do not know is that
some wont realize
and some wont see
my greatest fear
is about to be.
Life and happiness
are two things in my existence
l will never know again
after my fear begins.
Keep pushing me
in this direction
and i wont be here
for your detection.
My life force will slip past my fingers
into the hands of god
to where he will judge
where i belong.
Heaven or hell
or maybe even inbetween,
but know this well
it was were i was meant to be.
My destiny was something i could not change
but i chose this path all the same.
If you find someone who knows my fear
tell them not to worry
for I will hopefully still be here.
My fear is my own
nothing can change that,
but if I have people
who care and want me back
then my fear will never be realized.
