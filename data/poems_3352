STOIC
Gaining inner peace
Not affected by outside circumstances
Not concerned which basketball team wins
Not concerned which football team wins
Happiness not attached to the losing and winning
Gaining happiness from deep within
Indifferent to the things beyond our control,
for we can tweak our mindset.
