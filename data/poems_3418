NOT CONCERNED ABOUT DEATH â€¦ DEC 15TH,2012
BY
JAMES BREDIN

Some of my old friends are dead though no gray hairs on their heads,
And there doesn't seem to be much concern about becoming dead,
Canadians are not that much politically concerned,
About their upcoming deaths or aware or even show discern,



Because it can't be planned and we have to wait for it to happen,
But death-with-dignity, though both illegal and hidden will not sadden,
Why is it legal in Switzerland but in Canada; it's forbidden?
Because of what our Supreme Court told Sue Rodriguez - all forbidden,



Our Canadian party politicians are not allowed to change,
Their parties instruct them that this is not strange,
Our politicians can't have an independent thought,
Especially about death-with-dignity, because that's distraught.
