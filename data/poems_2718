IT ISN'T YOURS TO KEEP TO HAVE IT
Move from an attitude to lose.
You can dry your eyes,
To stop a weeping that you do.
Do what it is you must do to know...
A dipping into pity pools,
Will hurt you more!
Choose not to be a recluse to show...
You've included sadness,
As an automatic habit.

Let go of all that sadness,
That for you is automatic.
Let go of all that sadness,
Like it's yours to keep to have it.
Move.
It isn't yours to keep to have it.
Move.
You've made your sadness automatic.
Move.
It isn't yours to keep to have it.
Move.
You've made your sadness automatic.
