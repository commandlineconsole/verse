CARING AND SHARING
we search for caring
and loves more caring
we need sharing
but fails, more to share
caring and sharing is the true love
anyone wish to share more
he can care more
then he should be cared and shared more...
but it is not easy to care and share
until we understand each-other
if we fails to share, no one will care!
