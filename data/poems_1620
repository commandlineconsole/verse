YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS
Simple pleasures are always worth
So collect them for your own mirth
And know that good luck is in your way
So count the blessings of each day
And know that happiness and fain
Are the things that're hard to gain
So if you want to be happy and gay
Then count your blessings of each day
And know to have future happiness dear
You have to take joy's good care
Because even small pleasures are worth
And bring you joy, peace and mirth.
