ONE MORE DAY
Add one more day
Of joy in the way
And do good things
And bring the spring
And learn to smile
All for a while
And learn to start
Happiness in your heart
Then joy will save
And will make you brave
And will teach you
To face trouble's dew
And this will narrow
Your path of sorrow
And then in your way
You can add one more day
Of joy and smile
All for a while.
