! HORSE AND RIDER
To lean forward in the saddle,
the reins slackened for a while,
to lean forward towards its ear,
its ear concerned with more immediate things,
across the muscled, tendoned neck
so much more a neck than human neck
with the urge to whisper some unformulated words
arising beyond a language, in the heart,
concerning some so briefly,
so deeply now perceived
of some equality hidden in humility
holding horse and rider
in some ancient bond of trust,
perhaps of love.
