MIDNIGHT PASSION
The clock strikes midnight,
And I hear you creep into my room,
For you are here,
To spark a fire in me,
That lights up the stars in the sky,
Into colourful fireworks,
That makes the temperature of the room hot,
So hot with the passion that we share,
For in each other's arms,
We are there,
In a blissful paradise,
That is lovemaking,
For this passion and I,
You are taking,
To boiling point,
Where this love burns deep inside my heart,
For our love is like the greatest art,
That could ever be created,
For I am burning up inside,
Where this raw passion,
Has nothing to hide.
