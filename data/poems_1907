REPETITION
What confusion
It's reached beyond my
logical thought process
My tripped-up conscious
Surprise
Surprise
Where'd that come from?
Completely unfathomed
Even through
Still trying
It won't throw me,
Off my style
I'll walk free,
Of you
You can't play me
You just can't phase
Me of normalcy
Repeaten
Repeaten
Repetition makes it true
Repetition makes it all so
When it's not all free
When you can't believe
Repetition makes me right
Repetition makes you gone
My life so clean
Wipe it off for a thought
When you can't even dream
When I can't just leave
Repetition
Repetition
Makes us all agree
