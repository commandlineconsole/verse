THE BEAUTY THAT RESIDES IN SADNESS
it is with great sadness that
i write
you a letter,
everything in it is all about sadness
it is not just about us
or you,
it is about the whole massive humanity
that is never drowned
with sadness but struggles in that ocean
of choices and so alone
amidst the
storms and the
other survivors
it is with great sadness that we gather here
and begin to hear
the sounds of all these forms and shapes and
colors of
sadness
i listen to you on an impromptu
and you listen to me
with all patience and with all sadness we embrace ourselves
share sadness with hugs and
at the end
we are filled with so much beauty
feeling so beautiful with
these massive sadness that
never leaves us free
we are bound, and yet when we face ourselves in the mirror of
ourselves
my goodness, we are so
beautiful
