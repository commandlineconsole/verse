LIVIN IN ANGER, LOVE, AND HATE
Livin in anger
Anger that has no ending
Anger that has no fear
Anger that has no wants
Anger that has no needs
Anger that will keep comin
Anger that will keep hurtin
Anger that will keep killin
Livin in love
Love that lives forever
Love that everyone needs
Love that will surpass everything
Love lives inside
Love that will make your life easy
Love that will make your life hard
Love that is so pure
Love that is so hateful
Livin in hate
Hate that haunts and haunts
Hate that creeps and sneaks
Hate that makes the best out of situations
Hate that makes the worst out of situations
Hate that tells the truth
Hate that people hide
Hate that people express with words
Hate that can and cannot be controlled
Hate that runs the world
Hate that everyone has
Livin in Anger, Love, and Hate
