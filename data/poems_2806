LIFE
Life is the start of a new beginning
Happiness is nutrition to enjoy life itself
Maturity is when the seed evolves in order to understand more from life
Age is related to maturity, when all is to see, what true state you are in, both body and soul
Sadness is the cause of grief, regret, hatred and depression
Accomplishment is the savior from sadness and beauty which refines all
Love is fragile, but yet strong, the cause of courage, motivation, hope, and the healing of a soul
Death is the end of the road, where memories are remembered, and where the reaper awaits to trial your sins
(March,2006)
