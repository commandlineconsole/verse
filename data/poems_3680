I KNOW WHO I AM
You can say I'm shy
I don't care
You can say I'm mean
I don't care
You can say I'm nice
I don't care
You can say I'm ugly
I don't care
You can say i'm beautiful
I don't care
You can say I'm wierd
I don't care
You can call me a freak or fast
I don't care
You can say anything about me
But guess what?
I don't care
Because I know who I am
