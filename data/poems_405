THE DESIRE OF THE DREAM
The desire of the dream
~
What thoughts of wanton passion
burn deeper and more fearsome
than the stirrings of the heart
that untamed tempest of desire
playing out wild fantasy to the mind
embracing the wild mystery
which exists in the unknown
~
what thoughts of wanton passion
are kept locked away
there, only for a dreamt escape
the touch of flesh against flesh
a kiss unlike any other
sweet mystery embraced and held
such passion felt, thought
burning deep in unchained heart
~
the stir of a day dream
a thought flight of fantasy
into the burning of a passion
unspoken and untouched
a few if any have realised
the desire of the dream
