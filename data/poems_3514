WISHING FOR CLOSURE ON A WELSH SHORE
Stood upon sea smoothed stones
that have been slowly shaped over
time, each one rounded, rolling
under the waves.
Looking down with haggard
concern the cliffs
cry white concern.
Rough tears that in time
will be smoothed and shaped
into one of many others.
The walls of the houses lean
to the left rooted by its foundations
the west will not wait.
Less and less becomes
more and more
the scattered
and the washed up
seek solace upon the
shore.
The burden of thinking instead
of relaxing pushes the waves
back into themselves.
Little girls laughing-
dropping grains.
Sprinkling the ashes of the past
As seaguls circle above
Surfers skim across waves
Sandcastles are made.
sewage seeps.
The battle of beauty and dismay
burns these eyes
on this stone streched bay.
