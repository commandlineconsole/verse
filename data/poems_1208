A LONG DISTANCE MILE
I had travelled for days and for hours
You greeted me, with beautiful flowers
a look of delight, a kiss and a smile
For you, I had travelled a long distance mile.
The promise of love and a silver band
In your clutches, engaged by that smile
For you, I had travelled a long distance mile.
The love we shared was our delight
'Welcome! your new life, to this new land'
then broken promises, in just one fight
Now all is lost but I remember that smile
For you, I had travelled a long distance mile.
