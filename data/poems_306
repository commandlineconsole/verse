WAYS OF LOVE
Love is mysterious
Love is soul
Love makes you want to grow up & grow old
Love is me
Love is you
Love is everything between the lives of us two
Love is boy
Love is girl
Love is a feeling that can mean the world
Love is man
Love is woman
Those are the things love makes you become
Without love i dont know where we would be
No me, no you, no ocean, no sea
Love allows us to be whoever we want & choose to be...
