MY ANGER
the anger in me runs very deep
it boiles and steams and now i dont sleep
my anger is mine and i can control it
my anger is mine and i dont want to hold it
my boiling point has gone past its level
all i see is red and sights of the devil
i was ready to explode and give my soul to this devil
then a voice spoke to me soft and so gental
a calm went thru me so peacefull and true
my anger inside me had nothing to do
its still deep inside me dormant and quiet
but if i lose my voice i will get very violent
and follow my anger where ever its takes me
the devil will smile cause he'll have his first choice
all evil from below will rejoyce
so heed my warnings to all need beware
do not touch my voice with the glowing red hair
