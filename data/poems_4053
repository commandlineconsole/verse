FEAR
FEAR IS EVERYWHERE,
YOU CAN NOT LOSE,
IT WILL STICK TO YOU LIKE GLUE,
IT WILL NOT COME OFF,
FEAR STALKS YOU,
WAITING FOR YOU TO COME OUT,
FEAR LIVES OFF YOU,
FEAR AND LOVE,
PEOPLE SAY FEAR IS CONQUERED BY LOVE,
BUT IS LOVE CONQUERED BY FEAR,
LOVE IS FEAR,
LOVE IS THE FEAR OF NOT BEING LOVED BACK,
LOVE IS FEAR THAT WILL MAKE YOU SICK,
LOVE IS FEAR KNOWING THAT YOU WILL MAKE A MISTAKE,
FEAR IS EVERYTHING,
IT IS EVERYWHERE,
