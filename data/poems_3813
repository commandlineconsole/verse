DEATH SERVES IN THE WARS
death serves on the front line
he is on no one side
and he dose not care who or why
death serves on your side of the front line
death serves on the other side of the front line
he dose not care who or why
he will tack a soil like a soldier tack a life
he dose not care who or why
he has no regret not like a soldier who has the regret
he dose not care who or why
the soldier says to the life he has tacks sorry for what ive done
the soldier says what have i done
the soldier says who are you and why did i do this
the soldier cares who or why
who should tack the blame at the end of the day for tacking a life
the soldier who cares who or why
or
death who dose not care who or why
