THEN I LOVE YOU
If seeing the beauty of life through your eyes
Is love
Then I love you
If needing you and wanting you
Is love
Then I love you
If growth comes to mind when I think of you
Is love
Then I love you
If I cannot picture life with anyone but you
Is love
Then I love you
If trusting you with my heart
Is love
Then I love you
If trusting you with my thoughts
Is love
Then I love you
If putting you before me
Is love
Then I love you
If everything is you
Is love
Then I love you
If writing this poem for you
Is love
Then I love you
If loving you
Is love
Then I love you
If every part of misses you
Is love
Then I love you
If smiling when I see you
Is love
Then I love you
If being lonely without you
Is love
Then I love you
If every word is meant and felt
Is love
Then I love you
If dreaming of you everyday
Is love
Then I love you
If appreciating what life can offer
Is love
Then I love you
If being a better person just for you
Is love
Then I love you
If dreams can come true
Is love
Then I love you
If making you my number one
Is love
Then I love you
If swallowing my pride
Is love
Then I love you
If the best is what I want
Is love
Then I love you
