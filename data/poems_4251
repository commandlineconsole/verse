FEAR IN THE SHADOWS
The stroke of midnight arrives
A gust of wind slowly grows in every direction
A full moon has awaken high above the Earth
Revealing shadows never seen in daylight
Leaves rustle with the wind and scatter
Just loud enough to wake all the dreamers
Eventually they will imagine their greatest fears
Without closing their eyes to see them
These fears begin to frighten them more
A nightmare without the need of sleep
Giving them the ability to see them
The chance to fight their fears at night
Fears can be conquered when faced
With new ones eventually taking over
The break of daylight is faint
Any fear can be defeated by everyone
