KNOWING WHAT IS FELT WITHIN
There is nothing quite like,
Being honest with oneself.
Knowing what is felt within.
And how it affects...
Without concern of what comes next!
That's the best reality,
One can possibly get.
To admit mistakes...
With a forgiveness that it takes,
For one to move on!
Remaining strong and keeping a faith maintained.
After going through the motions...
Of living a life in pretense,
That 'something' about it has been lived well.
Until something about 'that'
Awakens one out of its limitation.
To realize...
There is nothing quite like,
Being honest with oneself.
Knowing what is felt within.
And how it affects...
Without concern of what comes next!
