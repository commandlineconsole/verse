HAPPY 10TH ANNIVERSARY
With hops and prayers
With happiness layers
I wish you joy and fain
A life without any pain
Where birds sing well
And happiness dwell
And sky shines bright
To fill joy's light
Where no clouds of tears
Or any kind of fear
Enters in your life
Where you survive
I wish you luck and joy
I hope you'll always enjoy
Whatever you'll do in life
That's a wish from your wife.
Happy Anniversary Sunny
