WHAT IS LIFE
this thing we live
if we call it life
we are wrong
life means hopes
and dreams to me
but sadness and
tears means death
to me
so why we walk
around with no
happyness
on are fares
we live life
without life
sometimes we
are always dead
we cant help
the sadness we
feel the pain
we have inside us
do we hide if
you can be happy for
love ones that we have
are we people of lies
our faces change
but our felligs dont
you cant change
the pain we hide
inside our minds
the feeling of
hate thats pain
and sadness
