FEAR IS THE KEY!
Fear is the Key!
Frightened to day as usual everyday
With;
‘Things to Do’ through out the DAY
Music’s to face ahead of the DAY
Frightened about the shave; and that After Shave!
Not sure yet; it may cut or it may cajole
It may burn or it may sooth
Not sure of the Soap Box
And Dye sachets/
Full or empty?
Can't trust even the ‘flush’ will do its duty normally or haath degaa?
Else, swindle me with empty sound ‘Dang –Dang’!
Maid Servant  ‘Aayegi or Haath degi?
Daily affair; but new-fangled every morning
Fear; every morning!
Fear every after noon and after
Fear till return home!
Fear till woke up in the morning!
A croppy list of this and that
Right from dropping the cheque in the box
Paying the telephone bill in the booth
Picking the kid from the school
Boiling the milk in the cooker
Fear of facing that cranky lady in the Bank;
Fear of ATM sign boards ‘inconvenience caused regretted’
Causes our heart bleed!
Fear of Credit Cards
Fear of debt traps!
Fear of crowded buses
Fear of lonely journeys
Fear of the owner!
Fear of the increasing rent!
Fear of pending work
Fear of bloodcurdling Boss!
Fear of haughty Hubby
Fear of wimpy wife
Fear of care free Kids
Fear of careless Parents!
Fear of fellow human
Fear of self!
FEAR is
THE KEY!
