AT THE SYMPHONY
Electrodes of music
stimulate the pleasure center
of my brain.
A study done on rats
shows that electrodes
placed in the pleasure center
of the brain
will make animals
forget sex, forget food
forget everything,
and seek an electrode high
until they die.
How mysterious
is the phenomenon
of pleasure.
