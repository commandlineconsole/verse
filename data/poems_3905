NEVER GIVE UP
Never give up on someone
Cuz you may be the only hope they have
They could be so close to the edge
And if they knew you were the only one
Who still cares
But gave up hoping and caring
It would send them over the edge
Someone who is all alone
Who is in need of a friend
A shoulder to cry on
This is the type of people who need love
And someone who cares
I mean really cares
You could be the person they need
So no matter what
DO NOT give up on anyone
For you never know
If they are on the edge or not
