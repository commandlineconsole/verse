WON'T BE HERE
I dont care if you ignore me
I dont care if your always busy
I dont care if you tell me you dont care
I dont care if you get angry
Just dont expect me to stay
so if you treat me this way
You wont find me here.
Its a simple give and take
If you show me a piece of your heart
I'll give you mine
but....
I dont care if you turn away
I dont care if you take your shoulder from me
I dont care if you still want me
I dont care if you break my heart
Just dont expect me to stay
So if you treat me this way
You wont find me here.
