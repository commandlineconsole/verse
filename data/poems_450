LOST
My passion at times has been dull
Others were there; I was null
Others spoke words; I have no dream
My soul cries out a common scream.
From this same well I no longer understand,
My soul; It fails to become grand
To sing my heart back to note;
And what was dear, I left un-wrote.
Now in my passion, in the light
A soul in turbid trite- saw blight
Around every corner unknown and foreseen
My passion eludes me; now still my dream.
In my nightmare, or the dream,
In my destiny left unseen,
In my passions that have me bound
The joy of words without a sound.
In the glory of the heavens,
A place not known to me,
In the death and resurrection,
And a souls second election
When others passions became that dream,
My demon continues to scream.
