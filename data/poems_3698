A TRUE FRIEND
Someone who cares when you're up
Someone who cares when you're down
Someone who when you mess up
Will give a smile instead of a frown
Someone who cares when you're right
Someone who cares when you're wrong
Someone who won't let a fight
Get in the way too long
Some one who cares to care
Someone who cares to give too
Someone who is not only fair
But looks exactly like you!
