O LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
Makes me so glad baby makes me so sad
Makes me so good baby makes me so bad
Your warm touch makes me feel like male
Your negligence burns me like hell
What is love baby who can tell?
You can make me feel so dreamy
You can arouse envy in me
Love can make me curse you baby!
