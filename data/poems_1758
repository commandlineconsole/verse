MOUTH  AND ITS ENDS.
I am all of your mouths,
With cheek, tounge, lips
And teeth, ending up in
Two holes differently both
In you men and women.
you use me without
Forethought shouts
At each other, sometimes,
Saying sweet nothings,
For praise, anger, and disdain,
You use my lips to mooch
In ecstatic bliss and use
For such nuptial pleasures,
Undescribable in words,
Even doing circus on beds.
You use the other end
For such morning pleasure,
For ejaculating the materials,
You injrst through your oesophagus,
With so much variety
And numbers uncountable.
Ravikiran  Arakkal.
