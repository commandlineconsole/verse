SONNET- LET ANGER NOT CONSUME ME
Let bitter anger not consume my soul
for its appetite is insatiable
let it not overcome me, all and whole
lest my will be unbreakable
Let anger not evolve into rancid rage
for then sweet countenance has no hold
and the big green man rules centre stage
letting lava spew till heat is but cold
Let rage not fuel itself into blows
to become only regret and shame
Let me not run to rage with eager toes
just to turn a fleeting ash to raging flame
Let not anger consume me
let calmness flow like tranquil sea
