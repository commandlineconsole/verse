TEARS
Each one holds a special memory,
Of sadness, pain and happiness,
Drop by drop,
A father passing,
Drop by drop,
A broken heart,
Drop by drop,
A child born,
Drop by drop,
Knowing the child is your nephew,
Drop by drop,
Losing your fist love,
Drop by drop,
Seeing your father lay there breathless,
Drop by drop,
Knowing all you can do is stand there watching him take his last breath,
Drop by drop,
Watching the person you love slip from the palms of your hands,
Drop by drop,
Jumping up and down full of giddy seeing your nephew being born,
Drop by drop,
Each memory is shared with each tear you drop,
All of Sadness, pain and happiness.
