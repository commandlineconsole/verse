WHAT IS TO LOVE?
to love is to hate,
to hate is to anger,
im lost in myself,
never feeling love,
never feeling hate,
never feeling anger,
i lost my pride to love,
i rejected love,
now its back to taunt me,
you're here by my side,
but not quite,
i muted your love,
i dunt know why,
love brings hope,
hope brings me up,
I love love even though love doesn't love my love,
love is easy to see at a view,
and is hard when looking through a dirty window when your face to face with it,
they say love is forever,
but i never knew that,
im not the one breaking hearts and closing chances,
its uncontainable just like my love for you,
