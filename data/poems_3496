BUSY OLD FOOL
Standing at a corner unseen to us,
with his dreadful club
what a busy creature he is.
Always watching our every steps
following our every movements
Busy old fool!
Rich men he respect not
poor men no concern he show
philantropists he show no mercy
wicked men he strike too
No affection he show to the beautiful
The ugly he show no care
Bloodless fellow!
Some he killed with sickness
some passed away peacefully in sleep
Injured greatly in the metalic  monster,
[plane crash and motors]
good bye they said to this world
Others, poisonous food they ate
and passed away
What a wicked being!
Not thinking of how we feel
Not considering how they would be missed
Not concerned with how good they are
He send them on an unreturned journey
What a heartless creature!
He's been performing his duty from the time immemorial
Countless  has been sent away by him
No assistant he want
He doesn't think of retirement for once
What a workaholic fellow
Busy old fool!
He who must live must die
He who shall die must live
Death is certain, life is not.
