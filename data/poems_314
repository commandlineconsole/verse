WHEN YOU LOVE TRULY
When you love me
you do not hurt me
when you love me
you carry me over obstacles in my path
when you love me
you help me with my problems
when you love me
you never say i'm fat
when you love me
you tell me that i'm the only
when you love me
you tell me you'll always be there
when you love me
you never let me be lonely
when you love me
you send me all your prayers
when you love me
i am there for you
when you love me
you know i care
when you love me
i never need tell you
when you love me
you love me truly
and i love you.
