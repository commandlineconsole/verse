YOUR SCENT
Your scent encases me
My second skin
It permeates everything
All at once satiating
While leaving me hungering for more
Leaving me open
Right down to my very core
Your scent encases me
Driving out the demons of memory
For new paths to be formed
Along their wake
Cementing new paintings in place
Ignoring the gossamer wings of time
So easily torn
Your scent encases me
My every breath waiting
To be set free
Time obliging, abiding
My whim
To be within your breath
Within your arms
Surrounded by the trail of your secret, your soul
Your scent encases me
Holding fast their silken bonds
And, oh rapture
To be held by such luxurious tethers
Held fast to your lust, your need
Only matched by the flames within my breast
The fires that only moments ago were mere embers
Slowly, your breath on my skin, your scent in my hair, come to life
Your scent encases me
I am left in darkness
No light does penetrate
My only salvation, your whispered words
I follow those sounds, those wisps of pure lust
My every breath taking in sweet passion
Your passion, my passion, our passion, as one we are once more.
