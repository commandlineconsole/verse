THE TREE
Based on the song: Magpies Riches
It stands up tall with the mystic blow
Of the polution in the air far, far down below
No one to see it, nobody to care
But a magpie sitting on a broken chair
Woodpeckers nuckle there beaks into its bow
No one knows how the tree does allow
No one to see it, nobody to care
But a magpie sitting on a broken chair
But if we visit, if we care
For the trees caring beauty and its bows in the air
We can take all the things that we blew to the breeze
Save our hills and the lonely trees
