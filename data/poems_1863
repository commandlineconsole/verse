THUNDER AND LIGHTENING
In a night made by truth
In a night made by youth
This rainy, rainy weather
We have come, we have come together
To admire nature's wonder
Surprising and lighting
See the world go under
A night full of thunder and lightening
At the site of truth
In the sight of youth
This show with this weather
We will, we will live together
To admire native wonder
Surprising and frightening
Habitual world go under
A night of thunder and lightening
Under side
Under sight of youth
This show with this weather
Won't we live together
Inspire a poet's wonder
Rising a tightening
Leave out ugly blunder
A night full of thunder and lightening
You shift, the storm begins (stark verstellt,
dunkel - Blaubart)
We dedicate us in
Under native wings
Under swing
When you feel this world
ain't yours no more
When you wanna fade out in lines some more
In moments with no hope left no more
When you feel you don’t fit no more
Then you need the thunder – surprising and
fighting
Then you need that lightening – surprising
and frightening
