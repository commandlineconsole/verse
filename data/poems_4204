WHAT TO FEAR
I need not fear a hundred battles to come
Because many thousands more I've fought
I do not fear the sword that awaits me there
Stuck with more, walking with them like a bear
I need not fear the fear of the unknown
Because its own fear left him scared below
I do, however, fear killers of dreams
While I'm alive they kill everyday from within.
