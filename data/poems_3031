A HEART FULL OF SORROW
A heart that feels
Such a great pain
Bond by restraints and chains
Ready to roam free
Like a lion untamed
To find something
More then sorrow
And pain
To find joy
Even a shot at love
Another heart
That could
Heal the scares that
This heart bears
A heart that’s strong
One that’s not scared
One that is not soft
But not fragile
That will fight for its love
But unfortunately
These shackles won’t
Be released anytime soon
So my heart sits heart dwelling
In sorrow
Maybe my heart can escape
That’s the dream I wish for
Tomorrow
But today
I must continue with sorrow
