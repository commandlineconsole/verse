SADNESS
Sadness is a dagger that's been sharpened to strike at your heart
Sorrow its edge, emptiness it's handle, together they impart
A cold lonely chill that resides in one's spine
Haunting it's victim on their spiral decline
If you long for one thing for so long
You'll miss other things along the way
Sadness is a wound that's been inflicted to the heart
Sorrow its ledge, emptiness a vandal,  together they start
A cold lonely thrill that provides self malign
Haunting it's victim as they walk the line
How many things have I missed on my way
As I longed for you to return to me
