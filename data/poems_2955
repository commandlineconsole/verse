DROWN MY SORROWS
Drown me,
Drown my depression,
Drown my sorrows,
All the things I have done hurts me inside,
I told myself that everything will be alright,
We shared so much,
All I ever asked myself to drown my sorrows,
When I look back the picture of how happy were,
I wish things will be fine between us,
Drown my sorrows,
Wash away the pain,
Wipe away my tears,
The chapter of my life is incomplete,
I was complete once but ever since I let you go,
I lost apart of me,
Drown me,
Drown my sorrows.
