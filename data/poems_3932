I DIDN'T CARE
The devil came to me, and told me to kill you.
So I did.
I heard you screaming and begging for life,
And yet, I didn’t care.
I didn’t care that you were in pain,
I didn’t care you were dying,
I didn’t care that I’d never see you again,
I just did what I was told.
I listened to the devil.
What does that say about me?
