DON'T FEAR
The clouds are heavier than your problems, amazingly you see them glide over your head, you've harboured fear for the rest of your life, like you broke the oath of upholding holiness of the tabernacle, I know  penalty bigots are a major weapon for mass immorality, but fear not, do the mistakes then count your losses the way you would count profits, tell a friend about them for a piece of mind, and magically you'll see how fear will finally manifest fortitude in you, fear of diseases, fear of war, fear of famine, fear of death, the world becomes a hell to you, the ocean in it the fire-lake, the atmosphere is meth, then your mind becomes the laboratory, madness is all that is left, be fearless before you lose your mind.
