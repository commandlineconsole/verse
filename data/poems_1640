KISSES OF TERROR
Those hands all over her
That threatening smile
All around her
Stolen moments of intimate
Pleasure that should be offered
To the beloved ones
If they too want to do
Those things heâ€™s done
To her when she
Was too weak inside
And too young to know
That kisses
Are meant to offer
Pleasure instead of
Never ending terror
