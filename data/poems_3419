ENJOY PROTETION
Parents protect children and welcome
For all the times to come
It is their concern and priority
They are blessed by almighty
Mostly mom is worried more
She is the only concerned person called for
Right from proper food to gong school
Children love more and make her fool
Excuses never stop with mother
She has everything to bother
If child is sick then she will be struck
Stop all the work and may feel weak
Father has not more to worry
Can never afford to feel sorry
But dreams about their future
Works hard to make it sure
Children feel overprotected
Often thrashed and reacted
But have nothing more left to concern
To think about studies only and wait for turn
Girl child needs attention and care
She can’t think of going out or dare
Mom and dad both worry more
All mothers have to clean the floor
Children’s world and mothers world is same
One is worried for health and other has nothing to blame
Everything is available with short notice
Only child has to fulfill the promise
So children enjoy protection
Enjoy it full without any question
Parents are guardian and philosopher
Always ready to look after and take care
