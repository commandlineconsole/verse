WATER MOON
Chilly, icy whispers falling through the sky
Closer yet afar from the fingers of my hand
Simple and in silence I watch them as they hide
From the sadness and the clusters of the man
And they twinkle, oh they twinkle in affright
Tey twinkle and sprinkle in the icy mist of night
I must have it, such beauty, such sadness that is ghasts
As a body that is seen but never will be grasped
