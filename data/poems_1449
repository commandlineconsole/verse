PLEASURE IS LIKE SMOKE
Pleasure is like smoke
Pleasure-seeker is like a cigarette smoker
Cigarette-smoker breathes in the smoke
The smoke breathes out naturally
If the mouth is shut it is breathed out through nose
Smoke does not stay, bad habit of smoking stayed
Cigarette smoker gets addicted to smoking
Pleasure don't stay
Pleasure-seeker gets in to bad habit of enjoying pleasure
Remember, inclination to pleasure is unnatural
Disinclination is natural
Taste is developed, distaste is natural.
