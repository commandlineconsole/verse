LOVE IS...
Love is fear, fear is weakness
Love is pain and leaves me speechless
Love is happiness, love is sadness
Love starts out simple then turns to madness
Love is beautiful, love is glowing
Love is flying without knowing
Love is treacherous, love is dark
Love at first sight creates a spark
Love is difficult, love is blind
Hence the reason love's hard to find
Love is sacred, love is hidden
Love in some ways is forbidden
Love is hot, love is cold
Love lasts long, but won't grow old
Love is lasting, love is longing
Love is where my hearts belonging
