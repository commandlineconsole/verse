HUMANITY
their is a sense of beauty
that only the concerning heart
can bring
overloaded and overwhelmed
with true sincerity
this then the reaching hand
that does dispel the fears
of the unintelligble hypocrisy
captures for a moment
the unimpeachable face of humility
and all that can be
humane in humanity
