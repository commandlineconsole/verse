BLACK
black as the darkest of the night
her neck is stained now, once so white
i thought she cried, i thought he heard
but blueness was of no concern
violet is less pretty now
the flowered tone that showed him out
spending moments to grow old
she didn't even see him go
she never knew she was so small
reflecting on the distant fall
and red is leaving from her lips
the blinding pain sears from her hips
clear morning comes, it's all around
though she only has black colors now
