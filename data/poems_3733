WHO CARES
scared ur friends might find out
then u would puton a pout
they might see me and u
but now i see u care 2
i would cry my eyes out
but i have no doubt
u might not feel strong about me
i hoped my love u could see
im the one that cares about u
i hoped u'd feel the same 2
falling in love with u
now i dont know what to do
u shouldn't care
if the stare
since we r the pair
who cares what the think
there words will only sink
who cares about what they say
their only their for a day
who cares
