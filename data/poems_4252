FEAR
She lived in fear
she never drank,
her lips
would touch no wine.
``````````````````
She lived in fear
she watched her diet,
on meats
she would not dine.
``````````````````
She lived in fear
she stayed at home,
gave accident
no chance.
``````````````````
She lived in fear
and died in fear,
she neither lived
nor danced.
