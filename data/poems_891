SONNET: LITTLE THINGS MATTER MUCH
Divine we feel when parched mouths/ lips well drink,
Tender-coconut water in midsummer!
On finding sea-shells on the shore, child thinks,
‘God made this world so beautiful, brother! ’
What joy afills the children’s minds when rain,
Drizzles suddenly on their way back home;
There is great joy when man is free from pain
Or climbs a giant geo-desic dome!
A beggar’s heart is filled with joy that’s true,
When given food after starving for days;
The joy’s intense seeing the rainbow’s hue!
The starry night with moon well proves God’s ways.
Some things though small afford a greater joy;
In Nature’s lap, all men ought to enjoy.
