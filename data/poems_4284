ALWAYS FEAR THE DREAM
Never fear the reaper
As he can't get you anymore, but you will
Always fear the dream.
Telling me that the nightmare
Will soon end is no option as I
Always fear the reaper.
My worst dream is the one
Of never ending pain, so we shall
Always fear the dream.
No one lives and no one dies,
It's all just lonliness, that is why I
Always fear the dream.
