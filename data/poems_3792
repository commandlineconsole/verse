LOVE DOESN'T CARE
So many times we think that Love can only survive
In the boundaries that we have set for it;
But
Love doesn’t care
About hate
Love doesn’t care
If you’re wealthy or poor
Love doesn’t care to Judge.
Love doesn’t care
Whether you’re healthy or sick
Love doesn’t care
About beauty or scars
Love doesn’t care
Whether you’re smart or not
Love doesn’t care
About what color you are.
Love doesn’t care
What sex you are.
Love has no boundaries
Except the limitations
That we set in our own minds.
