*WILLIAM BLAKE THE HAIKU POET
anger
I told my wrath
my wrath did end
anger
I told it not
my wrath did grow.
anger
I water it in fears
and my tears
anger
i sun it with smiles
and soft deceitful wiles
anger
it grows till it
bores an apple bright
my foe beholds it shine.
and knows
it is mine
anger my garden steals
when the night
veils the pole
