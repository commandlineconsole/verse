THE UGLY BLUE
Neva cared much about much
Neva cared much about what ya have or not
Only cared about you
Cared enough not to put you in a box
Of things like that I've had a lot
Yet caring doesn't make things right
Our wrongs don't make each other's right
Have you've been cold to my being bold?
You went to a place hidden from other souls
And now it's painted blue
I know it's in me to be
Be whoever I want to be
Yet the only soul I want to be is  me
My imperfections are visibly detected
You said so with your perfect self
Neva cared much about much
neva should care at all
Cause we don't have control of every other soul
Whose ways are faraway, whose ways are not ours
And sometimes not theirs at all
