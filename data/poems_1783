SPURTS OF HORMONES
Love talks, love scenes and love stories
Will trigger spurts of hormones-
Oestrogen and testosterone-
In girls and boys respectively.
Which in turn activate zones
Of sexual pleasure in brain.
Thus sexual pleasures are undergone
Without prejudice to virtues.
Elders must encourage youngsters,
And youngsters must shut eyes to elders
When they respectively indulge in love.
