WHATS TO FEAR
A fear to seize, a fear to conquer
Not to be said, not to be shown emotion
Shouldn't be labeled for it's instinct
Darkness hits the ground, it begins to chase it's prey
Don't think of it, for it shall not be an obstacle
Like a demon, it plays your mind and has many reasons to find
Don't carry on anyone's sweat pile,
Contamination reaches over you
Now you have created such a horrific suspense for yourself
Taunting it will not solve one thing
Ignorance is not a key
Fear is it's own monster
Fatality is it's effect
Anxiety has corrupted
Anxious ones are in the state of fear
Scared is of fear
Something's to fear
It shall never be near
Let it not be heard
