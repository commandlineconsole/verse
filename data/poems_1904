MY LOST TOOTH (FOR BEN)
My tooth right here, it came out,
It hurt a little, but I didn't pout,
Mom said, let's keep it, and put it here,
In a little bag, her face had a tear,
Tonight, she said, under your pillow there,
The tooth fairy will come, because she'll care,
Because she loves, and a good boy you are,
A surprise  she'll leave, after coming so far,
So when you wake up, and look with care,
under your pillow, right under there,
A surprise you will find, she left for you,
Because, just like mommy, she loves you too.
