THE GREATEST PLEASURE
Looking in to her eyes, i can see a vision
Looking at her face, i know there's a mission
Touching her hands, i know there's an hidden pleasure
And now i will have my greatest leisure
Kissing her lips, i know the world is cool
Holding her breast, i know there's a destination
Rubbing her body, i know that honey is nature
And inserting into the hole, i feel the pleasure of paradise
Ejaculating to the hole, i feel like to die
With the pleasure of today, i will come for it in the hereafter.
