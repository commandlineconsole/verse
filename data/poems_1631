ECHOS OF LIFE
Echo's of childhood, memories unfold
of simple pleasures and dreams untold
carefree and loving; years intertwined
echo's so sweetly  in my mind
Echo's of innocence, memories unfold
of painful loss and bitter cold
deceived and betrayed; feelings defined
echo's like storms and clouds my mind
Echo's of family, memories unfold
touched my life and grabbed hold
pleasure and pain; both combine
echo through these memories of mine.......
