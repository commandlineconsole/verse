I DON'T CARE
I don't care
if you change
because you'll still be
the same.
I don't care
if you plead or cry,
because when I did this
you ignored this sight.
I don't care
if you wait a million years for me,
just move on and
let me be.
I don't care
if you still have feelings for me,
because back then the feelings I had for you, you did not see.
I don't care
if you get mad,
because when I was down,
you were glad.
I don't care
if you even die,
because you hurt me that bad.
so bad that I can't stand your sight.
