DEAD IS MY LOVE
Long has it been forgotten!
A life of passion and romance and passion I once knew
Were love magically grew
And never was there a dull moment
But now no longer are my eyes filled with desire
When I see a guy I dream about
Now my heart no longer burns like an undying fire
How could I all of a sudden grow so cold?
Were did I go wrong
Was it all the pain I’ve been through?
Or was it all those that I caused pain
Why is that feeling I once knew gone
Is it normal am I the one to blame
Am I the loser in this love game!
I need to know it’s driving me insane
Can romance and passion really fade away?
Oh how I long to feel that love again
With every passionate kiss a granted wish
How I desire to feel that forgotten love I knew
Where I felt loved each and every day
And passion and romance filled my soul and heart
As a love between two people kept on growing strong
And nothing could ever take them apart
How I miss all of that as now dead is my feeling of love.
