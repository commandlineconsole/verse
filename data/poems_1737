LIVE AND COME AND BE OF ALL
Live and come and be of all
Sweetest pleasures to feel
This be as until there's fall
And the autumn to you is real
Sweetness from the love and brine
So much pleasure like birds sing
With here inside and line for line
Like there was the nesting spring
I will make this love all true
With fragrances of a bouquets rose
Always more every day there renew
Till the spring from my heart goes
Every bud may be of new blossom
With the hours they fulfill
Gracious time in pleasing awesome
Every moment with its thrill
-
Hour is coming in twilight living
Delight be gone before a rise
Each of life days is like buds giving
With every glimpse in life's eyes
