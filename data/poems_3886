NEVER EVEN CARED
HINT: Look at the title on this poem...look at the capitals...
You say you're  close
You say you're there
but in your mind
you never even cared
You leave me behind
just standing scared
and in your mind
you never even cared
You say you love me
but you don't even dare
because in your mind
you never even cared
I've learned not to trust
anyone like you, cuz you ain't there
and in your mind
you never even cared
