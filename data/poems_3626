SHORT MEETING LONG MEMORY
Even though i knew you
for just a little while
I'll always remember
your brazened smile
With concern and question
in your eye
The remnant of tear
from days gone bye
The shake from a hand
firm but meek
The voice of strength
to gaurd the weak
The blessing of journey
assuring future thoughts of you
So Thank You
for memories now done
and hope your times from now
Are Fun! !
