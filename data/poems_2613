TEARS OF SADNESS OR RELIEF?
My tears that I have?
What are they really?
Is it tears of sadness? or relief?
The minute I heard I held back
I didn't know how to react
but, is it tears of sadness or relief?
I saw it coming
I just didn't know when
I knew the love wouldv'e started
but, why did it end?
when I heard the words
I was speechless
but is it tears of sadness or relief?
I heard everything that was said
I know your plan
but, will you live up to it?
Is my tears, tears of sadness or relief?
I hope you know how I feel
and now I dont have nothing else to really say
cause' my tears aren't of sadness or relief....or maybe it is...
