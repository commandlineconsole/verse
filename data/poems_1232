I AM WORKING
Just I am working for you in a side,
My love for you is a chance to fold.
Inner delight reflects a danger to the mind,
Outer delight shines like the sun tomorrow.
My work journeys through time,
Pointing out the tensions and satisfaction.
It is adequate to have food to eat
When love has been smooth with work.
