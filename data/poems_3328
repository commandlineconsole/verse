ELECTION TIME, MOTHER'S CONCERN
in the concern of a caring mother
multiple anxiety craves in
in the clime of chromic cities
the air of egregious states
the naturalty of maledicted nation
particularly in tempus of electioneering where,
cadaverous polls frighten thumb printers
carnivorous contenders allay phobia in the aura
megalomaniac looters eye political cushions
impulsive poly-thieves breathe at the helm of brutality
blood and aqua exist in the bag of synonyms certainly,
motherâ€™s concern in necessary plausibility
and maternal restriction to vote in oodua land in obligation only,
very unfortunate the irony of politics is,
and as a patriotic citizen from a caring mother,
how regretful my situation cries
