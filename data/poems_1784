YOU HAVE A LOT TO OFFER
Put some joy and some pleasure
Add in it some laughter's treasure
Then mix it well with the spoon of care
So the mixture now can be called rare
Now put it in the pan of dream
Where kindness is flowing like a stream
And love is giving it a turn
And is giving it a perfect return
Now add I  it a pinch of smile
A carefree smile in your style
So this mixture can taste very sweet
For anyone who wants a special treat
And now when all this baking is done
Then top it with some joy and fun
And offer it all with the spoon of fain
Then count pleasure with it that you gain.
