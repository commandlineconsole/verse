THE FUTURE
Tomorrows stretched out endlessly,
So that continuing on is forever,
Offers life the possibilities of eternity,
But, in the present state,
That of mortal concern with the mundane,
Can the spirit guide life,
Into the wonders of the future,
Or fall, in the way of carnal existence,
Into the abyss,
Where the limitation of the here and now,
Are all that prevail?
