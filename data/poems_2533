PAINS OF TEARS...
Oh thou!
The souls of knowledge and emotions,
Speak aloud,
The damn vexed cause
Beneath thy remote silence…
Why thy strategy provoked with disgrace?
Why thy conscience showering angriness?
Why I have thrown into
An ultimate ignorance…?
Is thine soul least worthy
To thy own lass,
Is Ye the monumental patience,
Since thy irony character conveys,
Fretted hypocrisy…
Yore thy dramatic irony rang,
My soul pang.
‘Ye’ the Nobles,
A celestial architect
Of mine mortal aisle…
Let thy voice speak,
Me mine hope in its
Justice’s seek…
My destiny has sentenced
In custody of revolutionary chain,
It’s “Pain Of Tears”
My youth gain…
The Hands are kept
O’er my bosom
Nevertheless on my head
For the virtue of bliss and emotions…
Frailty My name,
Destruction of purity
Doth my fortune’s game…
Ye the noble spirits,
Ye the pride citizens,
The country’s fame,
“Me”,
A destroyed soul,
The country’s shame…
Loud thy cause for,
My existence abused,
Thy humanity reduced…
Let thine lips call not ‘Mother’,
Since thou thyself peel her feathers.
Ye the merciless mortality,
Indeed thy origin was in thy mother’s Grail,
Where in manipulating world of revolution,
Thou the demon
Destroying “The Holy Grail”.
Mine pains of tears in folding palm
Are in continuous pleading,
Chopped is my soul,
My grail is bleeding…
Thy life is flowing along
Horns and corns,
My heels are dragging over,
Deadly thorns…
My mortality is on motion’s cart,
Yore is my emotions and desires
A far apart…
The eyes of the world
Beholding discrimination,
Further is my birth
Suffering,
The pang of cremation…
Since decades and till,
Lad,
The symbol of honor and glad,
Besides,
Lass,
Whose funeral is in
Regular flash…
Forever and since,
Frailty is mine name,
I beg thou,
Do never thine
Courage of humanity frail,
Resulting when,
The Mother Earth
Will live still with discarded grail,
Leaving the world
To an ultimate deadly hell…
