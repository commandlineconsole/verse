DANCE FOR PHARAOHS
Egyptian spirits wake to view
A Wistful beauty make her debut
Barefoot as she moves in time
In shadows of the tomb sublime
Silky dress clings to supple breast
Her tiny waist it does caress
Hair gently blowing in the breeze
Eyes closed in a sensual tease
Physical moves for mystic kings
Wind accompanies her as it sings
Pale skin glow in soft moon light
Pharaohs and sons rising in delight
Magic sparks an electric night
Stars twinkling in blissful delight
Full moon rising in dark skies
Illusive sparkle in her brown eyes
