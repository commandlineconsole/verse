THE EID
You are my life, not its need
But for you, desert is my mead,
No pleasure without you in Eid,
No pleasure without you in Eid.
You are sole aim of my sole life
May Despair not cut it with a knife,
To it, my dear, I pay full heed,
No pleasure without you in Eid.
When I fail to find you anywhere,
I am filled with worry and care,
Worthless like dust become bright bead,
No pleasure without you in Eid.
Look, poverty weeps all around
But prosperity is nowhere found
How, on rocks, can grow sympathy's seed?
No pleasure without you in Eid.
Ah! I have seen women begging,
And the poor their grave digging,
Children crying no one to feed,
No pleasure without you in Eid.
Each one is worried about things some
And hard times that are about to come,
No one for happiness can plead,
No pleasure without you in Eid.
Harpies of thought eat up my peace,
Tears fall fast that do not cease,
Blood is suck so hearte do not bleed,
No pleasure without you in Eid.
Happiness you are my beloved,
With welfare you are related,
Where are you, see  has come Eid?
No pleasure without you in Eid.
