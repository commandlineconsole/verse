HER DEEP SADNESS
The violence in Gaza gives her a deep sadness. Headlines: Rockets Fire Into Israel During Cease Fire, Israelis of all persuasions sending aide to Gaza, Gaza school bombed-3 fatalities, Jewish family murdered by Salafia supporter to be closer to God, Deaths of 4 siblings and their mother in Gaza, Journalist killed in Gaza, Reuter's newsman killed in Gaza,12-year old killed on Wednesday in Gaza, Europe's Jews at risk for lives......of just a few in last 12 months
It seems firing rockets into Israel is wrong and against any rational decision making anyone concerned about the welfare of innocent men, women, and children would consider. It seems retaliation into Gaza is wrong and against any rational decision making anyone concerned about the welfare of innocent men, woman, and children would consider. To complicate matters the United Nations has a Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees calling for ceased hostility and a permanent cease fire while also disgracefully slapping the face of Islam in the face, not content with denying Gaza relief, but surrendering it through international resolution. There are to many inconsistent paradoxes in the entire situation from all sides. It seems the radicals, who are leading both sides, have no genuine concern for these issues, only carrying out their own agendas. Again, mentioned in my poem 'Mindset'- 'Forever chained to barren lands...where fragile wings cannot fly'....God be with us.
{This is not poetry and not intended to be as such, but an issue that affects friends I have on both sides of the issue, and it grieves my soul that the cycle has been repeated my half-century of a lifetime and maybe feedback might help me make meaning of it as apparently I am missing something in the rationality and humanity of the situation for unless something different is done the cycle shall continue...for my other half-century}
