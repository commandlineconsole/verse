A PIECE OF HEAVEN
The delicate chilled surface indented as I took a bite
I felt a coolness ooze down my throat
Filled to capacity with nuts, sprinkles, and chocolate raisins
The taste of vanilla and chocolate swirl filled my mind
And suddenly I was in a whole new place
My own escape, freedom of the world past
Oh! What delight!
Next, I heard the crunch of the waffle cone
The perfect shape crumbling against my teeth
Then it was over and I was back to reality
Oh! It was truly a delight!
