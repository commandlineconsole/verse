A WARRIOR’S POEM
A warrior’s poem
My anger bleeds my innocence away
Until all I am left with is the silence like after a question
In my mind I carry the suggestion
That I might be better off laughing my anger away
But I feel better being angry and seeing
My anger like the blood red flag it seems to be
Seemingly I wave it around trying to attract the bull and take it by the horns
Like my life since I was born!
Anger is a symptom of my frustration and sadness
A symptom of my friendless madness
A cross I bear
A sword I use to strike and to parry
Those who would leave me at deaths door
Yes and that goes for friends and loved ones
Who know how to hurt me the most
And raise a toast to my despair
Push my buttons and then stare back at me
Waiting for an answer
One day my anger is all I will have left
Anger at constant disappointment at still having life and air to breathe
But still having nothing in which to believe in but
The anger to prove everyone wrong
An obstinate man who says I will and I can
Prove the buggars wrong
and stay strong
no matter what they say
my warrior spirit will carry me on
and my anger will burn in me
until I fear no pain
then I will be a light shining bright and I will fear no one!
