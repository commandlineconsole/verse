DO YOU CARE?   DO YOU CARE?
there are people dying everywhere,
do you care? do you care?
there are people hungry everywhere,
do you care? do you care?
gunshots, bomb drops,
thunder splits the sky.
preacher on the tv,
says you're gonna die.
patriots, deviants,
doors ripped off the hinge.
children eating fathers,
freedom on the fringe!
equality, dignity,
slam the prison doors.
bodies in the ditch,
aint nobody keeping score.
nuclear rain, cocaine,
oceans full of oil.
god died, the president lied,
coming to a boil.
there are people dying everywhere,
do you care? do you care?
there are people hungry everywhere,
do you care? do you care?
black skin, white skin,
grated till they bleed.
angry men without hope,
taking what they need.
well paid lies, cut the ties,
glass figures stand in line.
love screams, shattered dreams,
the blind lead the blind!
trees cut, doors shut,
food stamps and day old bread.
schools closed, books burned,
hear the cry of the dead.
injustice rages, guilty pages,
we reap what we have sowed.
this world on fire, with desire,
the truth the final code!
there are people dying everywhere,
do you care? do you care?
there are people hungry everywhere,
do you care? do you care?
