MY LOVE SONG
I May lose my songs
The songs of heart,
Where none has the look
But the divine sprit.
Who then touches my thought
Who then predicts
I am the soul,
The earnest hunting thought.
The lover may lose the love,
The bee may lose the comb,
The mother may lose the womb
But I am the bird
And the passion which I hidden in my heart,
I never lose a single fragment of my song.
As the heart concerns
The love concerns
And as the love concerns,
It concerns with Lord
And as the Lord concerns,
It achieves the eternal dimension.
Life is there,
Where loves do exist.
Love is life,
Life is love.
As to worship the love
The life is created,
The earth is erected,
Only for the preservation of the loving soul.
