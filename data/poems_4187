I FEAR YOU,
I fear you,
I fear these masses,
When I never see inside their faces,
I fear what wrong I did,
Or maybe I wasn’t wrong,
You never know your fate,
When fear and strive increase,
Another story is told,
When a victim appears,
It’s in the news, the papers, the magazines,
When you read of these men’s patterns,
And you be thinking,
Disgrace to grace,
That I ever abide in knowledge,
So sufficient in solitude,
Prayer the perfect liberty,
I fear no indigence,
I fear no lies and disguise,
Let me stand straight and say,
I’m my way to the gate,
That’s not very easy to get.
