JOY
I have Joy
Joy in pain
Joy in sadness
Joy in discouragement
I have Joy
The Joy that comes from within
Innate with that of Christ
The Joy to do His will
I' ve got Joy
The Joy of Christ
Which eludes Him
When He finds a lost soul
I have Joy
An aftermath of obedience
Which is seen in salvation
Joy in Godâ€™s law
I have Joy
Joy in tribulations
Joy through tough times
Joy in various trials
I have Joy
The Joy that lasts
Though I might be visibly shaken
The Joy of salvation
What type of Joy?
That is the Joy of Jesus
The Joy that sustains
Though there are troubles
The Joy of peace
It is the Joy of salvation.
