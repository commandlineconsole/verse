FILLING OF PEACE
As God fills me with His Peace, concerns and worry begins to ease,
As The Spirit redirects my thought, peace within, by God is wrought,
Focusing more upon God’s Love, than the concerns, that I speak of,
As God continues to help me learn, He’s totally aware of all concern.
With the concern I presently face, His Spirit reminds me of His Grace,
As Grace from my Lord is able to, give me hope and see me through,
The darkest trial that comes in my life, in the strength of Jesus Christ,
This when I fix my eyes on Him, whose plans are made not on a whim.
God knows the plans that He’s made, and on The Rock they were laid,
And there’s nothing that can thwart, what God purposed from the start,
It is during the times when, I go astray, that testing may come my way,
As for all He purposes, it’s understood; it’s only meant to do us good.
Our lives and ways are not ignored, upon this earth by Christ our Lord,
And what may appear, at first glance, to be in this life a happenstance,
Is our Lord God working out all things, this as our lives together brings,
Eternal Glory unto The Son of God, as we live life on this temporal sod.
So through trials of an earthly kind, I’m moved to have a heavenly mind,
This as all things are working together, for that time that will last forever;
Trials and concerns may not cease, but, Christ grants me perfect peace,
As I look forward to what He prepares, in an Eternity which has no cares.
