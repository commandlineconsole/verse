'CARING'
Never underestimate the power of a listening ear ever
You will always need a helping hand to pull you back to your feet
If someone cares about you, that's when you should be very worried
When you don't want to care for anyone, just think about the loving care your mom has been through
Don't stop caring for a loved one even if they push you away
Its a wonderful gift that's made t impact friendships and many more
