A YOUNG DREAM...
Very early in the morning
He came awake a dream,
He in the throes of middle age,
Shocked at the dream,
where he was fondled
By adame of twenty,
Lying under him,
In the writhing, wriggling
Of passion, with open legs,
Kissing over and over
On the face, lips,
Again and again, waking up
to a graeat wonder
Why he ever saw
Such a dream of passion,
When he led a life,
Of peace, chaste, good nature,
And from may be god, who
had sent the same to him,
For eason beyond his understaning.
