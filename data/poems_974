UNIMAGINABLE LIGHT
Imagine the generation of darkness,
imagine the view of light,
imagine the joy that overflows the eyes that beholds brightness,
Darkness cannot comprehend the beauty and role of such imagination,
with feelings from Joy, Joy from brightness.
Building an unforgettable memory of happiness,
campaigning against blindness. oh!
what a rescue, rescue from the ages of blindness.
really, its light beyond words.
Yes, an unquenchable light that speaks life to the blind.
