SPREAD LOVE (MONCHIELLE)
Spread love in the whole world
You can just feel it within
Love just keeps on giving
Sow seeds of love everywhere
Praise God for all blessings
Spread love in the whole world
God gives us love for free
In hearts love brings a song
His love can give you peace
Love makes a heart grow strong
Spread love in the whole world
Obey God and seek Him first
His way is best for you
Love heals a heart that hurts
Feel and share His love too
Spread love in the whole world
Advocate love not war
In his love do the walk
Experience His love too
With love to people talk
