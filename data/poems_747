O JOY
O joy, O joy
Why have you forsaken me?
Leave me dwelling with the past of sorrow and misery.
My life was made of joy but no longer can I see freely
The Devils grasp is around me tight
Creeping from within I can not take it.
It is to ether give in to sorrow or remember what could have been.
O joy, O joy
Why have you forsaken me?
