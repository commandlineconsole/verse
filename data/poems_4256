FEAR
Fear grips my body
As darkness falls
Leaving me exposed
And defenseless against all
Fear grips my soul
As the beasts draw near
I cry out
Fighting the tears
Fear grips my heart
As itâ€™s held in your hands
Leaving me with
No strength to stand
Fear grips my mind
As rain pelts me
Relentlessly, it pelts
Until I can no longer see
Fear grips me
As worry sinks in
Leaving me with only
Sin
