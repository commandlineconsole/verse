WHO CARES
Who care if I die or end up in trouble?
Who cares what I do with my life
If I wreck it I wreck it
Who cares if their father or mother dies
Who cares if there grandparents die
I care do you care
Who care if I take an overdose of pills
Who cares if I end up pregnant
Who's shoulder is someone crying on
For they care is it mine or is it yours
Who cares if you break up
And finally know it's through for good
Who cares if someone says your
Other half has been involve with so and so
Who cares you should care
For one day you'll think who cares
I care do you care
If not your not human
For every human being cares what happens
