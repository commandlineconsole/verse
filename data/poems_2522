ANGER
I feel anger all around me
beside me
it guides me
it cuts me
it hurts
Sometimes i think whats the worth
when one day ill leave this earth
Death is what i feel
Death i want to kill
I want to leave
Im scared
No where to go
I feel all alone
I have no home
Just a sad old house
Fight is all we do
Fight
I dont need you
I'll make it on my own
I'll make it all alone
..........Anger is all around me.......
