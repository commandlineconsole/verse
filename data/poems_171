A LOVE ABOVE LOVES
When I think of you
I think of a certain kind of love
When I hear your name
I hear a certain kind of love
When I look at you
I see a certain kind of love
When I hold you
I hold a certain kind of love
When I kiss you
I kiss a certain kind of love
When I touch you
I touch a certain kind of love
When I fell in love with you
I fell in love with a certain kind of love
When I'm with you
I'm with a certain kind of love
When I'm wrapped up in you
I'm wrapped up in a certain kind of love
This certain kind of love
Is stronger than love
It is a transcended state
A love that can only be gifted from above
A love that is greater than any other love
This certain kind of love
Is strong and true
This certain kind of love
Makes two people stay true
This certain kind of love
Can never be extinguished
I believe that we have this kind of love
A love so true
Maybe not love at first sight
But I do believe that I was meant for you
Do you believe it too?
This certain kind of love
Is a love above loves
This certain kind of love
Is a true love
So true
