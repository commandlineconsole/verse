DREAM OF FEARS...
Tears from fears to desire to despair
Tears of fears from progressive to chronic
Tears to fear of the future from the past
Tears became fears of the unknown of being something from nothing
Tears to fears I am.
Tears from my fears I will face it, grasp it and hold on to it
My dreams
