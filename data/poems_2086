DRAGULAR
I'm choices ahead
but I love to act surprised
it's the good that i've done
it's the present that I want
It's like my neighbor's pet
she could smell what's going on
as long as i'm doing something
she will go wherever I am

This promise so sweet
a whispered wish so hopeful
This brightness so hot
a guiding light so blinding

I thought I can own it
and conquer as I see it coming
It's disguised a stray dog
meanwhile someone's holding its' neck
You can put your name on it
that's all you're deemed to do
You can study the trails it leaves
and forecast its' next route
but it loves to surprise you
or at least it wants you
to act surprised like me
then the rest is predictable
