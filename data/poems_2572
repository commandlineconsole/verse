SADNESS IS ABOUT
This is such a sad, sad, sad day, the sun
shining in a sad way, the very air I breathe
is sad, the music in my ears crying in violin
and sad theme, all comfort lost, security is
but a memory in the past
The flowers at my work station looking at
me sadly, yellowed leaves moving sadly
in the draft, even the ubiquitous office din
is sad, the smile on every mouth is sad,
sadness is creasing reality
Everything falling into tears and despair,
sadness overwhelming and no release
near, sadness colouring my soul until I
am wearing the deepest purple shroud
of loneliness where nothing else
But sadness is about
