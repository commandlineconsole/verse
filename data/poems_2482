ISN'T THIS HEART BROKEN ENOUGH?
Why must you tease me
Why must you hate me
Isn’t this heart broken enough
Why do you hate me
Make me take all your anger
Isn’t this heart broken enough
Why do kiss me
If your love is untrue
Isn’t this heart broken enough
Why did you pull the trigger
When you knew I was there
Why do you make me feel the pain
Of you not being there
Take all my anger
And all my pain
Turn it into
something I can gain
Now it’s the pain of a broken heart
Now it’s the pain of an unrequited love
Its pain of a heart shrouded in darkness
It’s the pain of this heart
It’s the pain in my heart
