(2010)  THE BLACK SHEEP
I shouldn't care that I'm a failure in the eyes of pretty much my entire family.
I shouldn't care that I am not good enough.
I shouldn't care that everything I wished for in life is nothing I will have.
I shouldn't care that I will always not be good enough.
I shouldn't care that I am but a burden in the eyes of my parents.
I shouldn't care that that I've never been good enough.
I shouldn't care that I have forever been not enough.
I shouldn't care that I am the Black Sheep.



And yet, I do.
