MY JOY
My Joy is in knowing that I can still breathe
While dozens die around without a breath to spare
My Joy is in knowing that I can still walk away
While many are concealed and enslaved all the life
My joy is in knowing that I can still sing
While songs of much hearts have been culled too often
My joy is in knowing I can still see through
While thousands of other eyes have always stayed blind
My joy is fathomless, unmatched and undulating
As I mock your gloomy faces and can't guess one reason
What makes you so sardonic and a so muzzled up being
While all that you did was to eat, sleep and earn
My joy comes from the place where the day is not so bright
But the illuminating hopes kindle like a thousand suns
My joy comes from the molasse where life is unkind
Yet they smile like it is a new start each dawn
Have you ever been to those people and places
Where Joy is a piece of bread they share helplessly
Where Joy is a thin plastic sheet to screen the winter wrath
Where Joy is a new hope each morning and a solitary consolation by dusk
Where Joy is the nothingness unattended by us, yet celebrated by them
For they laugh over our misery that we want to be richer yet
While all the while they are the ones who know where the riches really lie.
My joy is in knowing that I can sense the difference,
Between things in life and life in things.
