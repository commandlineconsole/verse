THE FEAR THAT LOVE CAN DRAG OUT OF A PERSON
i fear our love
i fear that this relationship will come to an end,
i fear that you will get bored of my pitty,
i fear that i might say something wrong,
i fear that you will cheat because you cant see me,
i fear that i will not be missed if my life shall end early,
im scarred of the commitment and the honesty that we may share,
but most of all i fear of being ALONE.
