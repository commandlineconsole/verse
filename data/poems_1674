SHARING DREAMS WITH YOU...
I picture you in my mind
Desire I know is there
Nestling in your arms
In the dreamy love affair
I imagine you next to me
Softly kissing my skin
Touched by your hand
As pleasures flow within
I lay here upon my pillow
You whisper sensually
My whole body tingles
Feeling you close to me
I have fed off your hunger
So I intend to continue
Absorbing the pleasure
Sharing dreams with you
I AM HERE TO EVERY THING WITH YOU MY SWEETHEART...
Dedicated for My Love...
Please don't copy... thank u...
