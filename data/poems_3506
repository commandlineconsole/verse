BIGOT
I hate most of all the damn bigots
The closed-minded fools
The idiots who have forgotten
How well they have it.
If there's something I've learned and should impart
It is - keep an open mind and heart
Because as soon as you close things down
Start ignoring other peoples reality
You become a fool.
I'm meeting them in their thirties and forties
And much more concerning, in their twenties
So pampered and conditioned and soft
That life seems like a boring, waking dream
A consumerist paradise
A subtle yet potent Hell.
I'm walking around knee deep
But not in my own mistakes
The mistakes and stupidity of others
Which bring my own concerns
Rushing up through the gullet
An unstoppable nausea.
This bigotry, this form of prejudice
This soul-rotting, irritating thing.
I often feel it's what holds me back
My own pre-occupation with this
Hate made manifest.
