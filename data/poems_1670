LUSTFUL DELIGHTS
the past knocks today
at your door
looking for you
last night's sensual pleasures
stick to your body
like a branded perfume
someone as crazy as you
suits to this ailment
as my body aches for more
of those unsolicited pleasures
ripples of delights
on a love masking for truth
the luxuries are thrown away
for a better feel
you are the prey
and there is this beast in me
crowned with lustful supremacy
everything is light
except the heart heavy with guilt
still in the darkness
not waiting for any move
