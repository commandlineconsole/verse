ORGASM
it is the life energy
it is the desire that controls everything
it rises toe, moves up
for a while settles in heart
then continue its path to brain
there it erupts
spreading the hot wind all over the body
still something holds in my adams apple
an unexplainable sorrow plunges my heart
is it pleasure before pain
or pain after pleasure.
