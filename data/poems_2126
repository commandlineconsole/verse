THE DAY I MET YOU
The day I met you
you caught me by surprise
I never knew you existed,
I wanted you to be mine
I thought you were so fine
But what took you by surprise
You never knew I existed as well
Until this time
As days went by
People told me stories
They were so unique
You’re the one and only kid
I really wanted to meet
What worries me the most
Will you see me the same
Or will you see me as another one of those games
I don’t know much about you
And you don’t know much about me
But if we weren’t so shy
Maybe we can learn something
I know its going to be tough
For both of us
But if we at least try
I know we can get by
