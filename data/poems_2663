WE LIVE IN AN OLD UNIVERSE OF PAIN AND SADNESS
WE LIVE IN AN OLD UNIVERSE OF PAIN AND SADNESS
We live in an old universe of pain and sadness
With billions of deaths behind it
And many billions more to come-
Murders in tons
Cruelties beyond conception-
We live in an old universe of pain and sadness
Of life and death
In which cruelty plays its crucial part-

How much less lonely and more beautiful would our lives be
Could we only dream that all beings were only kind
And all touching of others done with love and gentleness.
