PRISON OF SADNESS
Here I am again in the same place that I started from
Hating frustrating coming undone
Lost in my own thoughts
Negativity in my head
Seeing the world differently
The sadness slowly taking over
All that I believed before
Paranoid
Not able to see what ‘s in front of me
Manic to the brink of  destruction
I am at the point now, where I am ashamed
Of what I am thinking
Private thoughts that I think that everyone can see
Scared of what they would think of me if they
Could see the real me
Right through me
My soul is transparent
Color of night
I can’t see the light
I am stuck in my own prison of sadness
Locked away to rot
