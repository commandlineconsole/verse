CONSEQUENCES
Happiness and sadness
Both in contrast
You are happy to have finished
But sad to come last
Sadness and happiness
Together as one
You are happy it’s not raining
But sad there’s no sun
Happiness and sadness
Always together
You are happy that you passed
But sad you aren’t clever
Sadness and happiness
Come in a pair
You're happy it’s only a dream
But sad it’s a nightmare
Sadness and happiness
Build confidence
But at certain times
Lead to consequence
