YOU
You
hoarding your sadness -
a dragon keeping his gold
to himself
as if my chemicals
influenced yours,
You who come with bandages
to fend infection
and cover my wounds
You sending me away to cope
to learn to grab hold,
You locking the gate
and with a look backwards
destroying what you had mended
so it falls around my feet
so Your sadness might shine
a little brighter in their eyes
(March 08)
