NEVER FALL IN LOVE
I believe in love
but never fall in love
true love or lust love
I want love
but never fall in love
am I so cold
and don't have a heart
or so stubborn
and raise wall stone
I search love
but never fall in love
platonic love or passionate love
I'm loved
but never fall in love
am I afraid
to be hurt by the one
or kill it silently
before I find it's gone
I get everything
but never fall in love
I want to love
and wait all my life
should I pick one flower
and pretend it's love
pseudo love, unrequited love or mutual love
so desperate to feel
but never fall in love
