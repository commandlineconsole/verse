CONCERNING JOY
When an infant laughs,
especially at nothing,
joy has scrawled a note
for anyone to read
and get a giggle.
When people see someone
they love receive what's right,
joy juices a corpuscle of time.
When you sense that thing
move through you, the one
that feels as if your bones
just told a joke to your nerves,
which then told your feet
to dance (knowing full well
your feet ache)  joy just might
have been nearby. Mercurial,
needed, and nimble,
as small as a thimble
and as big as a moon,
joy is, I'm telling you,
welcome most any time,
including midnight,
noon, and soon. I'm
saying something about
joy, okay? I'm not trying
to reproduce it, so don't
get all joyless on me. If
joy comes to you, let it.
If it doesn't, ask around.
See what you can find out.
Somebody has to know something.
