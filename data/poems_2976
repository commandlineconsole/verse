SORROW FOUND ME
Bought a ticket for a train
swam the deepest underwater caves
booked a flight on a plane
but I found nothing had changed
Sorrow still found me
But still I ran away
booked a mysterious holiday
Drove through the United States
I even changed my name
Yet Sorrow still found me
I wish he didn't know me
Wish he'd never told me
He'd come back looking for me
No one here to console me
Sorrow is so persistant
Now I know there's no hiding from the pain
I've got to stand up and face the rain
I only pray that someday he may go away
Sorrow, I hope you will forget my name
