WHAT KIND OF LOVE?
Love is very illusive, yet it is everywhere
Some love themselves
Some love money
Some love what the world provides
Some love earthly things
Some love power
Some love falsley
Few love true
Few love God
Few loves love
The world is full of fools
If I'm a fool to love
So it be
I will rather be a fool,
A fool to believe in love
Than a fool without love.
