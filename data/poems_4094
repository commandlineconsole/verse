WHEN FEAR CONQUER MY LIFE
The world has many fears
Every people has one of them
Even me, it makes me tears
When fear comes, I'll be one of them
Fear is my all time weakness
When fear comes, my world goes round
In my world, you will feel sadness
Because in my world, fear is all around
Fear comes to my life,
When happiness comes, it will turn to sadness
Because fear is killing me using its own knife
In my life there are fears that can be my weakness
