DEATH AND LIFE
Death
Death is the dead
Death is the living
Death will take the living
Death will make them the dead
Death is unforgiving
Death does not care about life
Death only cares about the dead
Death will never give up the dead
Death
Life
Life is the living
Life is the dead
Life will take the dead
Life will give them life anew
Life is caring, thoughtful
Life cares about the dead
Life cares about the living and dead
Life will not give up the dead or living
Life
