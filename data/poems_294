FORBIDDEN LOVE
I think of you all day long
But I know I shouldn’t
I think of you all the time
But I know I shouldn’t
The most
Tempting
Love there is
Is the forbidden
Love
He’s the forbidden love
Forbidden love
Always looks better
Forbidden love
Is oh so tempting
Forbidden love
You gotta have it
Cuz you love it
Its forbidden love
You know
That I love you
But you’re forbidden
I know
That you love me
But I’m forbidden
What it is now
Everything was better
When he was forbidden
But then once I got him
A.G.A.I.N.
It’s not as tempting
Now its you
That I think of
And I’m still forbidden
Is this forbidden that you have
I know
That my love for you is
Forbidden
Forbidden
Forbidden love
Always looks better
Forbidden love
Is oh so tempting
Forbidden love
You gotta have it
Cuz you love it
Its forbidden love
All I can ever do now
All day long
Is think of the
Forbidden love
That I have
You know
That I love you
But you’re forbidden
I know
That you love me
But I’m forbidden
So tell me
Why is the forbidden
The most tempting
In the love
Why is the forbidden
The most wanted
Then your current love
There’s forbidden love
He’s my forbidden love
