SUICIDAL THOUGHTS
I rock back and forth as
momentum rushes through me
so many options so many chooses
oh the pleasure of death
how to go how to go
painless but there is  no joy in that
pain filled oh yes feel the cord
around my neck tighten up
as i get ready to pop
or burn in the infinite flames of hell
yea and feel pain like nothing before
to escape this world
is my goal
no longer do i hang on
so i'll turn my back to the angel of death
this is my kill you don't get to have this one
i'll take the pleasure for myself
i'll end my own life whiles you watch
knowing this one escaped you
hahaha
i laugh at you for this one was to great for you
as my eyes close up
i feel the life slow draining
out of this carcass
tell me do you wanna feel my joy
ohhh such great joy
losing it as i laugh insanely
so many options to try
so many ways to go
its a pleasure i get to experience
ohhh six slips yea on each risk
pull the trigger and get the pleasure
but to quick
dismemberment, .. slow and pain filled yea
you will love it,
over dose sit and lose it
as i feel all the pain from before
in this one little bottle of pills
so marvelous so joyful
which way to go
hahahahahah
which way to go
