IF ONLY...
We all cared about this Earth
and our fellow man,
There would be no wars, over
religion, wealth or land
We all cared about Justice
and lived with conscience,
There would be no starvation
homelessness or exploitation
We all cared about Truth
and the power of love,
There would be no disharmony
fear, doubt or treachery
We all cared about Life
and the beauty of nature,
There would be no destruction
slaughter or devastation
We all cared enough to Change
and united as one,
There could be a real tomorrow
God’s will… be done.
