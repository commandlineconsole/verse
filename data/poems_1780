I'LL INITIATE TONIGHT
A candlelit dinner
A sexy negligee
Come to me my darling
I'll guide you all the way
Undress your skin of cover
Reveal unto me, your physique
For tonight there is no judgment
No discussion, no critique
Come lie down beside me
I'll kiss your mouth, so sweet
Lie my hand upon your chest
Feeling a heart, of tender beats
Allow my hands to wander
To explore your outer shell
Pulsating, pleasing pleasure
Engorged, I feel you swell
Our sensual act continues
Engaged in intercourse
Bodies intertwined
Without regret, remorse
Euphoric excitement
Sexual tension, maxed
We succumb to pleasure
A beautiful climax
