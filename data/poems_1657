IL N'Y A PAS DE QUOI  (DON'T MENTION IT- YOU'RE WELCOME)
Il n’y a pas de quoi, my darling
You’re welcome, it was my pleasure
To be there for you when you needed me
And to go away when you were done with my love
Il n’y a pas de quoi, my beloved
For I am nothing but a wall of stone
With no feelings or emotions
And I care not of my disposal at your pleasure
Il n’y a pas de quoi, my angel
Because you are so extraordinary
That my sentiments do not matter
In the presence of your egotism
Do not mention it, mon amour,
You are quite welcome
For I am your eternally happy marionette
And my static smile is yours to keep.
