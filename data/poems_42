LOVE
I am so in love
In love with Joy
In love with happiness
In love with anger
In love with frustration
In love with Tears
In love with Me.
I love love
love is fruitful
Love is Kind
Love is Motivating
Love is Comforting
Love is love
I hate Love
Love is painful
Love is heartbreaking
Love is deadly
Love is poisonous
Love is Evil
Hey stop it
Love is like what
I don't know
All I know is Love is Love
so say all you want
But I know Love is
and I love love
I love me & you
