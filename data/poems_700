THIS JOY THAT I HAVE
Oh, this joy that I have,
This joy that fills my heart,
This joy that keeps me smiling,
This joy that picks me up when I am down,
This joy that never ends,
This joy that my heart sings about,
This joy that makes me clap my hands and dance alone in my room,
This joy that gives me a new song,
This joy that inspires my dance,
This joy that the world can never take,
This joy that never asked for a price,
This joy that fills my soul,
This joy that sets me free from all my worries,
This joy that I can't explain,
Oh, this joy! The joy of the Lord is my strength.
