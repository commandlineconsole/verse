SADNESS NO MORE..
Sadness, please stay away from me
I was alright when your not here
So please, please leave me be
Everything was going right, and everything was fine
‘Till you came one day and broke this perfectly straight line
I used to know happiness and it filled my heart with glee
But you came and wrecked it all
Now, look at what you did!
Happiness is now leaving me
I miss the days where it’s just happiness and me
Where everything felt right and I was happy not empty
Why aren’t you leaving yet?
Haven’t I suffered enough?
You have made me your prisoner
I can’t continue with this bluff
So someone please, free me from this cell
a tight room with no smiles,
My own piece of hell
As I continue with my endeavor of leaving this place
This place called sadness; I’m leaving with no trace
Now I’ve found the door, the door that would lead me out
Out of this place, now my heart has left with no more doubt
Now I had let go, the things that sadness had done
Now its time to be free, time to smile
No more frowns or tears,
I would have none of that, none
So I’m wishing sadness the best
For I’m letting it go and I want the world to testify
This six words I wont sadness to hear
So long sadness, so long goodbye
