NO ONE CARES
In this world we are living in
No one cares to the others
No one cares where we have come from
No one cares even to the sound of drums
Except the lovers
No one cares to the birds'chattering
To the parallel hearts never reach in
No one cares to the flowers to the Roses
Except the lovers
No one cares to a drop of the rain
To the kindness, to a poor child who is drained
No one cares to the dancers
Dancing like the mads
Dancing in the rain, dancing on the sands
No one cares to a smile
Which is not because of guile
No one cares even to these words
Coming through out of my throat
Except the lovers
