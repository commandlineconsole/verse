WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU
I love the way you hold me tight
I love the way it feels so right
I love the way you read my eyes
I love the way you're jealous of other guys
I love the way you love me back
I love the way you give me what I lack
I love the way you kiss my lips
I love the way your hands land on my hips
I love the way you wipe my tears
I love the way you help me fight my fears
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way your love feels so real
I love the way you talk when you're sad
I love the way you blame me when you're mad
I love the way you're so forgiving
I love the way you're always giving
I love the way you're so comforting
I love the way you're always supporting
I love the way you make me feel so unique
I love the way you don't make me feel weak
I love the way you swear to always be mine
I love the way you're my sun that will always shine
