MAKE MY SPIRIT SOAR
That flat feeling after reading too
much too fast, all the bubbles
spilled in one emotional blast
afterwards the feeling is gone
in a flat emptiness
Caring for nothing, nothing stirring
my feelings; relativism pervading
my space, realizing how small my
concerns on the larger canvas
of all forms of life
Searching for a larger goal that
will make my spirit soar above it
all, human concerns are not big
enough, the goal of life is to find
how to be happy
Hedonism is not it, so what will
it be, for what objective shall I
sacrifice and how much will I give
up - I charged like a meteor through
many universes at once
If I slow down, what will I find?
