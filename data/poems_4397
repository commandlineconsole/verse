DIZZY POEM
and i feel this yearning
and fear
fear of the yearning
yeanring for the fear
all the painters
and visionaries
plugged up in morgateges
and jonesing
we all need shelter
although it's limited
becoming more and more
tooth and nail
dog eat dog
as we get baser
mine is to observe
and record
live it out
i will look
and type
and starve and yearn and fear
