TONGUE IN ANGER
In anger, whatever
The tongue utters,
May be loud to ear
But, are the words bitter.
Anger talks hot words,
Provokes and instigates,
Bitter the relationship
And happiness desolates.
Utter in anger un-pleases,
Heart beats increases,
Peace and patience seizes,
Emotions, controls un-eases.
Happiness lies in love,
Loving fetches the joy,
What you give same you take,
Anger or love receive back.
For happiness keep you normal,
Emotions and anger controllable,
Liquidate the ill thoughts,
And keep you hospitable.
