THE FINDING
you found me broken and bleeding
left to die in the middle of the floor
you walked through my blood
mended my heart and helped me up
you put a bandana around my bleeding wrists
you held my hand as we walked through the mist
crushed and broken my world was
everything you touched darkend and died
thats the way i like it
you brought my blood red moon and river back
and my dead trees and black roses
surprise surprise my world is dark again
it makes me happy to know that you care
to know that you love me
and want me cause i love it when you stare
