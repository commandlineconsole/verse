MY SADNESS
My sadness wears many hats
I am sad to lose a friend
It saddens me to watch my son cry or
To visit the grave in which my mother and brother lie
The sadness i feel never leaves my heart
I have recently found the courage to make a new start
To put my woes and despair behind me
To allow my sad heart to find a new smile each day
To help me along my way.
Without my sadness i could not have found my happiness
