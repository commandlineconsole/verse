SUMMER
Summer, Summer bright and sunny
I love to see many bunnies
Happy place it brings me joy
Happy place it brings me joy
I love how it makes me happy
And it doesn't make me sappy
It brings joy to everybody
Happy place is Wonderbody
Wonderbody is so sunny
That's why I love many bunnies
It is night so the bunnies are gone
I must go home and run along
