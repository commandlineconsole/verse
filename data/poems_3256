STRICKEN
He was stricken
overwhelmed and afflcted
full of sorrow and misfortune
wounded by life
could'nt see the sparkle
of his life, his family
he died with his lies
a memory now tainted
a perfect portrait
now splattered and splotched with tears
blurring the happiness
exposing the pain
we are all now stricken
overwhelmed and afflicted
full of sorrow...
...wounded by lies
