LESTAT- THE VAMPIRE'S VILLAIN
Vampire surprise words from your mouth
Like thee moving into shadows of thy lives
Vampire surprise alarming words in thy thoughts
Like thee creeping into mysteries all thy lives
One man one vampire throughout the ages
Centuries after centuries Lestat thy image
From man to vampire mystery after mystery
Refuge thee seek thy comfort in sage
Disturbed hidden silence of thee may
Thy Lestat thee noble thee thy lord
Lover oh thy mortal and immortal alike be
Watching thee phase after phase thy deep vault
Come out come out where ever you are
Thy invitation to the world to show thee
Vampire thy hidden coffin of fresh dreams
Flower for thee day twas Lestat clue
Vampire surprise wherever you are
Lestat thy reminded thee of fear from destiny
Leaving in the shadow thy company
Come out come out throughout eternity
Lestat that’s what you are vampire
Yet man of self esteem bold and bare
Thy creature night and day vampire
Man of self destiny lover and hater of thee
