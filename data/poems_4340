I WON’T GIVE IN TO MY FEARS
I won’t give in to my fears,
I am not one to just give in and say screw it,
You may be that type of person,
But I was told never to give in to my fears.
Yes I worry but I still face my fears,
I am a free willing person,
If some one ever tried to take advantage of me,
I would take action right away,
Face my fears be an adult,
Giving in to your fears,
Is what a child would do,
I’m not a child,
But you are,
If you just throw in the towel and say screw it,
So one day I hope you will learn to trust in God,
And not give in to your fears,
I won’t give in to my fears,
