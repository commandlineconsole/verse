THE LOVE POEM
Love is understanding
Love is compromise
Love is generosity
Love is sacrifice
Love does not discriminate
Love is free of charge
Love is the solution
Love is who we are
Love is universal
Love is heaven sent
Love was fastened to the cross
Love's greatest testament
Love is triumphant
Love is somersaults
Love is compassion
Love is free of fault
Love is forgiveness
Love offers a hand
Love is eternal
Love is His command
