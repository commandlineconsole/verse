JOYS OF LIFE.....
Smiling farmer see his green harvest,
Fluting cowboy under the old tree,
Excited boy flying kite in the blue,
Marigold in the chignon of village bride,
Dangling braided hair of school girl,
These are boundless joy.
The retired recalling his business,
Face of street child having a chocolate,
Child dreaming with the lullaby,
Smell of the rose while saying love,
Returning home after a tiresome day,
These are boundless joy.
First date with the dream-girl,
First feel anyone so closer than own,
First saying someone 'I love you',
First see beloved waiting for me,
For the first holding own child into arms,
These are boundless joy.
Who says there is no hope?
Who says there is no dream?
We all hope, we all dream,
A life full of joys, boundless joys,
Whether the sorrows for today,
And these joys forever.......
