AFTER JOY COMES MISERY
I am the sweetest Fool ever known
A Black soul of love unsown
A description so strange, you wonder why
To tell you the truth, you’d begin to cry

For I do love a lover’s love
So limitless like the sky above
But even the sky has an end
Where nothingness and darkness starts it trend

So I guess my love limits has finally reach
And the holes in my heart has spoken their speech
And shown me to embrace the loving hate
It also brings joy and happiness, in of its own state

You may be confused, the loving hate?
It’s a dish served cold on a black plate
It’s as mellow and sweet as a home cook meal
It’s the feeling of no feeling, a deal of no deal

With its joy loneliness is around the corner
Oh how I wish this dark joy can last much longer
But all good things must come to an end
And once again sadness becomes my friend

Joy always goes whether it’s good or dark
Circle of life, Oh what a heartless track
After joy comes sorrow and sorrow brings misery
No matter how you run misery is always misery

I have enjoyed the joy of living clean
Enjoyed the joy of the darkness within
But both left me shattered like a priceless vase
Forgotten like a poor man criminal case

So this I say this, enjoy your joy
For misery comes like a childhood toy
