SONNET: WHAT JOY!
I lost a book and found it at long last;
The joy when I saw it again was great;
I lost many other things in the past;
I searched my house entire like a feat!
I lost my poem new and almost cried;
My heart just leapt with joy when I found it;
I lost my wealth-details and almost died;
God gave them back after I prayed a bit.
What joyful tears filled father’s eyes when came
His prodigal son after many years!
What joy afilled a mother’s heart when blame-
Afreed daughter returned home without fears!
The joy that fills heaven when souls are saved
Cannot be imagined by minds God gave!
