PARADOX
Shadows fall
And I go numb
A thick brick wall
I lose my thumb
Calm my soul and rest my arms
You gently ease my weary mind
Caught up and captive to your charms
You mend my heart with your touch so kind
The light through my darkness
The song in my pain
My joy after sadness
The rainbow through the rain
You woke me from my sadness
Rouse me from my painful sleep
Exchange my tears with laughter
And banished all my fears
And then there is silence
A deep moving sadness
The folly of existence
A sweet haunting stillness
