JOY
If you want to see joy,
You must tell every girl and boy
That life is a wonder and dream...
And the joy on their faces
Is enough to last all places
And your heart will sing with joy!
To see love
Is enough
To last forever...
To see joy
Employs
Us together...
If you want to see joy
You must give your child a toy
And the happiness it brings
Is enough for a lifetime...
Joy to all and joy joy joy!
