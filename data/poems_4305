WATERFALL OF TEARS
This is where
My fragile heart
Used to beat
All torn apart
But now just
Empty. on the left
Side of what
I suppose is my chest
Rip away
My doubts and fears
So I don't drown
In a flood of tears
But sometimes
That waterfall of tears
Can wash away
All my fears
Heartless. Cold.
That's what they call me
Not entirely true.
I'm numb and I'm free
And I thought
That I was strong
But it turns out
I thought wrong
Rip away
My doubts and fears
So I don't drown
In a flood of tears
But sometimes
That waterfall of tears
Can wash away
All my fears
X marks the spot
Of the exact place
That shouldnt be found
I gotta save face
Save me
Please
I beg you
I beg me
Rip away
My doubts and fears
So I don't drown
In a flood of tears
But sometimes
That waterfall of tears
Can wash away
All my fears
I need you to say
It'll be alright
I dont know if
I can make it another night
I'm crying
You can see
I'm crying 'cuz
I can hear your heart beat
Rip away
My doubts and fears
So I don't drown
In a flood of tears
But sometimes
That waterfall of tears
Can wash away
All my fears
