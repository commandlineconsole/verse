A DARK HAIRED ANGLE
a dark haired angle falls from the sky
the stars surley bleeds and the heavens slowly die
with  he eyes full of sadness and her hair dark as night
her arms thrown wide open just to hold her true love tight
her skin badly cut from the blades of despaire
her heart bleeds with sorrow from a world that dosent care
her wings torn and broken from the lies and cold pain
for shes conceeled in warm sadness and shall never be the same
