HAPPINESS - PART: 2
Anger!
Anger is all I feel in place of my happiness!
It found me, and I embraced it.
Then, in all of it's evil glory,
Happiness turned on me!
Made me bitter, and angry.
Why? Why would it do this to me.
Now Pain is my only friend. Heartbreak is my companion.
Anger!
Anger is all I feel in place of my happiness!
