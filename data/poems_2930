AUTUMN LEAVES
Never weep, have no sorrow
Just pretend there’s no tomorrow
Leaves are slowly falling down
Red, orange, green, and brown
Swiftly gliding in the air
Softly landing in her hair
Never weep, have no sorrow
Just pretend there’s no tomorrow
She is sad, with much grief
It feels as if there is no relief
More leaves pass her by
She sadly watches as they fly
Never weep, have no sorrow
Just pretend there’s no tomorrow
Another leaf is falling down
Floating toward a head of brown
A boy reaches for the leaf
Noticing a girl in sadness and grief
Never weep, have no sorrow
Just pretend there’s no tomorrow
Carefully grabbing her tiny hand
Before a leaf begins to land
The moon, gleaming in the sky
Little boy and girl say goodbye
Never weep, have no sorrow
Just pretend there’s no tomorrow
Boy and girl meet once more
Both are older than before
Slowly walking down the isle
The groom gives her a handsome smile
Never weep, have no sorrow
Just pretend there’s no tomorrow
Leaves begin to fall once more
Lady weeping by the shore
The man’s name, carved in stone
The woman is left all alone
Never weep, have no sorrow
Just pretend there’s no tomorrow
One after another, days go by
Here is the woman, left to cry
The leaves always tumble down
Even though there’s no head of brown
You can weep, have much sorrow
Just remember, there is tomorrow
