ANANSEKROM
Water-lilies and springs of tulips,
Shooting images with my digital camera;
And from 'Edloman' to 'Anansekrom' with love,
But it was, surprise-surprise-surprise! ! !
I have the peace of your love in my pocket,
And in my heart is always with your muse;
But always identified as the Queen's Language,
And this global culture is all around us today.
Of your love and of your muse,
Of my mind and of my works,
But, so sweet and very attractive is your muse behind thwe camera;
And like the safe of my mind to touch you with my hands.
