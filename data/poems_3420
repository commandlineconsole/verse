TOO LATE THE HERO
Please do not feign interest in my life
Do not pretend that you are concerned for my welfare
What do you really care if I am out all night?
Didn't you go out and gallivant for some 20 years on your own?
When love should have brought you home.
Please do not pretend that you love me
You love your ugly cousin everyone can see
The one who isn't aging gracefully
The one you once admit you love wholeheartedly.
Please do not feign concern for my safety
It is just sheer jealousy that it is at play
What you really care is just enslaving me:
To be at your service 24 hours a day.
Please do not try be my hero
Because you are 20 years too late
And it makes me very angry
All the fake concern you throw at me.
