THE WRITTEN POEMS
Ah, which is not poetry
Sun and moon, day and night
Birth and death, merry and sorrow..
Happiness be if idyllic poem
Even sorrow a dolorous poetry..
Yes..lovely poems
But sorrow is not sorrow to swear
Inside the inside, inside it a dream
Rolling is sorrow on uncaged glee
A glee of unfettered wishes and desires
An aesthete of the secret soul..
Yes..a lovely poem
And gaiety too not so to swear
Inside the inside, inside it a guilt
Pricking the soul is the wakeful conscience
Awry-sorry-karma on wrong rungs
A fake upping of the secret soul
Yes..a lovely poem
Ah, just in bliss of ripened years
Connoisseur you rejoice them
Glee and guilt, aesthetes of secret soul
Written poems in every godly creature
Found and read in appreciation to acclaim
Oh..lovely poems
