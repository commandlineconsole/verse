NO PASSION
you touch me but  feel no passion
but love hurts some times
i can see the pain in your eyes
but still you tell me everything is fine
i still have feelings for you
but some times i wonder do you still have feeling for me
i try to increase my passoin for you
but your passion i cannot see
so now i am kind of backing off
hoping my hearts feelings can go away
and still i see know passion from you
so now i have nothing to say
