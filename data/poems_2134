STAR SCREAMER
I won't be treated like some disease.
I'm not going away.
You can shoot, but I won't bleed.
I'm here to stay.
Don't be surprised
By my rebellion.
The lights flee your eyes,
Taken by this Hellion.
If you must fight, fight hard.
Stay proud, stay true.
This song's for you...
Star screamer,
Little dreamer.
Crown your new king,
I am your leader.
Galvanized in a ring
Of fiery fever.
I'm not surprised
By his retaliation.
The lights flee my eyes,
Taken by this reincarnation.
I had to fight, I fought hard.
I stayed proud, I stayed true,
I hope that you do too.
Star screamer,
Little dreamer.
