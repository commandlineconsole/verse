THE ETERNAL BOND
Marriages are made in heaven,
With Life God plays Beethoven.
The Song is for an eternal life,
Full of joys for the lovely bride.
To this song the heart dances,
To the sky of joys, it glances.
The glance seems forever,
The joys multiply and shall fade never.
With this bond  dreams are made,
May the dreams come to life with a joyous shade.
