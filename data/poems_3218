WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU?
What right have you
To lament your love
When the widowed lyrics of my unrequited love
Remain unread?
What right have you
To sing your sorrow
When the clenched rhythm of my forbidden sorrow
Remain unvoiced?
What right have you
To fake your fear
When the solitary tune of my pregnant fear
Remain unheard?
What right have you?
