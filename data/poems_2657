REALLY VERY EMPTY
It is better to remain sad
At least sadness you can predict
Predict, that sadness will forever be
Sadness will only increase as it never decreases
As the positives turn into negatives
Negatives into blanks.
Blank spaces are forever to be as no answers remain
It is confusion, just confusion ahead
Ahead of me as I know nothing about my future
My life is empty, really very empty.
