LOVER'S SONG
Crescent moon and falling stars
Travel across to where lovers are
Love's first kisses taste so sweet
Capture true bliss so complete
Passion fuses into sweet surrender
Precious memories so often remembered
Lovers deeply intwined in soul and spirit
Unspoken words and distance that cannot bear it
No matter what time can separate
A love like this patiently waits
In depths of love so sublime
Across an eternity of endless time
Lovers etched in passion so deep
True love eternal will never sleep
