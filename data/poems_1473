* * THE PLEASURE OF LIFE
Someone to live
Someone to believe
Someone to die
Someone to cry
Someone to stay happy
Someone surrounded by glory
Someone to be sad
Someone to complain with God
It is all just life's pleasure
Keeping in contact with the treasure
Sometimes harmony
This creates joy fairly
And sometimes it is terrible
When death comes in way which is incredible
What would be life's pleasure?
Happiness or sadness creator?
Unknown proud or grief of future?
The answer is also from the life's pleasure
Life's pleasure
The unknown treasure
Dedicated to youth dead accidentally
