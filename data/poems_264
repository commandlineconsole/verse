LOVE
Love, Love, Love
That's what everybody needed
They say 'I love you'
But I think you have a mistake in saying it
Love, Love, Love
many professionals had defined it
yes, they can tell what it means
but they can't explain anything
Because Love has a mysterious side
That God only knows, so you can't lie
Love, Love, Love
is the greatest thing that you receive
but it's actually hard to give
Like Loving an enemy
you surely says, 'I'll rather die, honestly'
Love, love, love
is more than a feeling
it is doing good to someone and sacrificing
But there is  an easiest  way to find it
just open your heart and let everyone to come in
