MY HEALING PROCESS
Let a thousand promises
Not lure my thinking faculties
Let it water the roots of hope
As my thoughts adopt a na√Øve approach
To comfort internal intentions
That only through time
Realise the depths of the obscurity
Found in heart of promises,
Let my life experiences
Teach and lead my spirit cautiously
To a path less intricate
Let a bank of tears lessen
The atrocities build with fear
Of unknown forces that circle the notion
Of my conscious aspiration
Let the scars and stamps of melancholy
Show mercy to a destiny destined
To undergo sorrowfulness
Let the solitude of the world
Spring forth priceless companionship
Let zillion phrases of gold and silver
Cover the ears of men and women stationed
On the pillars of a temple build with love and infinity
