SIGN
The line is fine between
Death and Joy 'cause
When comes time
that some ploy for a dime
Your joy may subside in
the death of divine.
The death of divine
brings joy to your side,
The ploy you applied
sprung back 'till the time
'cause the line over death
you ignored joy can find.
You shoud've noticed
The dime was a sign.
