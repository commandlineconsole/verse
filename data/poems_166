LOVE IS
Love Is Love and Love Is You
He sat at a white Marble table
with a fine crystal vase
with two beautiful red roses
He is drinking coffee from Brazil
and thinking of you
Imagine your in love with him
And he in love with you
Love is...
Love is...
Love is a feeling that is so sweet
Love is a feeling that you cannot beat
Love is a feeling that you feel deep down
Love is...
Love is a challenge you have to face
Love is an emotion you must embrace
Love is a topic that stays on your case
Love is...
Love is an issue that cannot be ignored
Love is around when things get bored
Love is like a bird ready to soar
Love is...
Love is around when times get bad
Love is there when you get sad
Love is really all you ever had
Love is...
Love is me and love is you
Love is made not by one but by two
Love is the feeling felt by you
Love is...
