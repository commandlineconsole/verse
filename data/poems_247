LOVE
Love conquers a battle fought by thousands
Love makes the journey of a thousand miles easy to embark on
Love binds the heart
Love builds the soul
Love gives breathe
Love grows like a flower
Love unfolds the deepest secrets
The sword of love is sharp
It pierce through the heart
Love heals wounds caused by lust
Love brings out light from the darkest part of the heart
The sea of love is vast
It has no depth
The root of love is deep
Can't be easily uprooted
The arrow of love is enchanted
Can hit anyone
The thunder of love is charmed
Can struck thousands at a time
Love is the only factor
That is superior to others
