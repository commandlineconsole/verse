I FEAR TO SPEAK
I fear to speak
I fear to walk
I fear misquotation
I fear distinction
Still I am here to speak
Some words
Excuse me if I go
Out of control
In the process
Excuse me if I try
To live besides you
I know there is really
Potential danger here
I know I am color blind
I know I commit mistake
As a human being
O my dear bear me
I am just a passing tourist
And a curious onlooker
And in rising temperature
I fear I fear.
