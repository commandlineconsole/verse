GIVE AND TAKE IN LOVE
Sensation in love
To give and to give
In love
Never asking to gain
In love
Giving is not waste
In love
That makes you winner in love
More in love
Give more love
In love
And take more
A silent in love
May heart talk in love
Sweet talk of heart in love
A song of heart who in love
A silent heart who in love
A loud talk of heart who in love
