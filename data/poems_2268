BE GENTLE WITH WORDS
Anger is directly proportional to the opponent
Yes it’s true we fight with the feeble
Today I saw this man shout and curse

I have known him for years, he is a rat
Only can speak behind peoples back
His gestures now is forever worse

Why can’t people control anger when put to test
Hurting words, that you can never reverse
Why can’t we be gentle with words than curse?

Control your anger for its nothing great
Hold back your anger for it’ll only break
Let the fragrance of our words, spread as rose
