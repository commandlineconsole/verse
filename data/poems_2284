SONNET: WHEN ANGRY!
Help me, O God, to hold my anger fast;
I must be cool while facing foolish mobs;
Their irritating methods cannot last;
Their misdemeanor gives me extra sobs!
In angry mood, mind’s function can be lost;
Avengeful is the angry heart of man;
Even the life of one, anger can cost;
Anger reduces the human life-span.
Control your anger ’fore it ruin brings;
An angry man can’t think or reason out;
An angry muse cannot unfurl its wings;
When anger strikes, man has about God doubt!
Just inhibit the vicious emotion;
Anger works like a dementing potion!
