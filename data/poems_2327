ANGER
It starts with a slight
A misspoken word
A certain look
A conversation not heard
You try to stay calm
To just bide the time
The anger stays strong
as the day wears on
Emotions build
The anger flashes Red
Right or wrong no longer matters
Only the thoughts in your head
The need to vent
Lingers around
Giving voice to the hurt
Can be soothing sounds
Swallow the lump
stuck in your throat
Take a deep breath
Try to cope
Don't let anger get you
Turn your good day to bad
You'll be left all alone
Frustrated and mad
