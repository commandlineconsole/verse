WHAT IS LOVE?
Love makes you happy
Love makes you sad
Love makes you laugh
Love makes you cry
Love puts you up
Love puts you down
Love fills you with excitement
Love fills you with doubt
Love fills you with joy
Love fills you with resent
Love puts a smile on your face
Love puts a frown on your face
Love makes you patient
Love makes you unpatient
Love makes you agree
Love makes you disagree
Love fills you with hope
Love fills you with regret
Love makes you nervous
Love makes you anxious
Love makes you discuss
Love makes you argue
