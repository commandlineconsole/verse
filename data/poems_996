HAPPIER OUT LOOK
Let happier be your out look
Let you find joy in every nook
Let you seek for the pleasure
That comes with fain as a treasure
For life is really another name
Of pain and trouble in life's lane
So forget the tears and learn to smile
That can spread joy for a while
So for that have a happier out look
And let you find joy in every nook.
