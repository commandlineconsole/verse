FEAR NOT FEAR...
Death is to fear
as flour is to bread.
It sits at its very core.
It's the foundation,
it's the cement.
It gives fear the strength
that is needed for it
to touch the world
like a religion.
Many people feed fear
to people as if it was a
meal that cannot be skipped
in the <beepin'> day.
Fear is as nourishing as poison.
It kills thoughts because
thoughts are being targeted.
Fear is one of the main tools
that is swung in the hands of
a swine-like politician.
Fear not fear, fork it
and
it out.
Don't let it contaminate you.
