WINTER ROSE
A winter rose is very rare
Whose delicate petals weep
As the bitter north winds blows
Them fiercely off to sleep
They awaken from their slumber
Beneath a warming sun

And rise to stretch in glory
As a new day has begun
The winter rose has flourished
Through the passing time
A symbol of life's passion
And love that is sublime

A new beginning, never to end
A life's passion, deeper than the sea
Embracing this thirsty soul
Never to be separated again
By the north wind blows..this winter rose
