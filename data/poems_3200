(GETTING)  SORROWS
And even now you're who I will miss
Guess you are why I don't face any bliss
Guess it's brilliant
How fell for you before I'd hit that sack
But it was just a cumbersome fact
Tears are streaming
Tears always now steaming
For there's only waits when I sit in these old bars
For blind again just due to the smoke of cigars
Form fades from good when I cry from afar
As for now I'm getting sorrows
Fight against chances that are gone
Here I am again as getting sorrows
Fight that are gone
Has got no new good fun yet no new good fun
As you're the reason why I still heave
For maybe you're the reason why I feel deep
Who to even beâ€¦
At the moment I dunno me
For there's only waits when I sit in these old bars
For blind again just due to the smoke of cigars
It fades from any good when I cry from afar
When I cry from afar as I'll cry from afar
As for now I'm getting sorrows
Fight against chances that are gone
Here I am again as getting sorrows
Fight that are gone
Has got no new good fun yet no new good fun
Coat my eyes with that of wool
As there's always lies
Won't expose my heartfelt pines even though it's a while
May not show it a while
As for now I'm getting sorrows
Fight against chances that are gone
Here I am again as getting sorrows
Fight that are gone
Has got no new good fun yet no new good fun
But I cannot break myself yet so free
Yet you're how I did misconceive
Just stuck to be
As there's nobody else I can be
