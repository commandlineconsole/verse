THE SADNESS OF IT ALL
THE SADNESS OF IT ALL
The sadness of it all-
The pain of it all-
And I have given my life to this
And what has become of it?
And I failed twice-

And what has become of me?
An old man doddering alone and without any real hope of making it right -
Writing his delusory words of consolation to himself-
Which he secretly believes the world will one day listen to-
Oh what a fool and a failure
This pleasant rogue
This wiseman of his own small idiotic jokes
This ancient emptiness on the way to a difficult darkness.
