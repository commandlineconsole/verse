MY GREATEST LOVE
I first fell in love when I was young in grade school
With nature whose magic and beauty was all around
Like a butterfly to the flowers I was drawn
Oh, the joy I felt, the joy I felt, the purest I’ve ever found.
In high school, in my mid-teen, I fell in love
With a girl whose beauty could captivate all men
Thoughts of her filled my mind everyday, every night
Oh, the joy I felt, the joy I felt was heaven.
This love was intense, and music made it more so even
Love songs and music I search the radio through the nights
‘Till I discovered the classics, the symphonies of Beethoven
Oh, the joy I felt, the joy I felt was the ultimate pleasure.
In my late teen, after much reading, thinking; the human mind
The most mysterious, complex thing; I was awed and fell in love
I couldn’t imagine the infiniteness of its wonder and beauty
Oh, the joy I felt, the joy I felt must have come from above.
Soon all this led to my greatest love before I was twenty
Since then for decades, my mind, my thoughts it’s occupied
But where is the joy I must have reaped for loving this Humanity?
Why have I instead been getting pain, sorrow and bitterness?
