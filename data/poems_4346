A WAR I HAVE YET TO FIGHT
Its not over
i think
no fear
only rage
i will finish this
in my story this is not the last page
i steel my self for battle
my battle ax raised
i let a scream tear its way out of my throat
no fear
no fear
no fear
no fear
my mantra echos through my brain pan
you don't care
you cant care
you wont care
caring is for those who do not intend to make it out alive
its convincing on my face
but my heart beats fast with fear
i let my eyes darken with the pseudo-lust for blood death and gore
i will strike fear into the hearts of my enemies
and inspire horrified awe in the minds of my successors
i tell myself
this is the beginning of a long and grueling war
a war once bravely fought by so many before me
i whisper in my own ear
this is
freshmen year
