JOY AND ANGER
Joy is an overwhelming feeling to be happy,
But more, To feel so delighted with God, you see;
It's an awesome happiness, that makes one delighted within,
A life so pleased and coping cause God's taken away their sin.
Anger is a time of hurts, and feelings of terrible fury,
That you just see everything negative, one's mind is blurry;
It gets one so mad at everyone who'll disagree with you,
And all you do, is to get into a tether, and end in a stew.
Joy is like a rainbow, such beauty and glowing for all to see,
It makes one laugh,   To feel delighted at the smallest bee;
It's a gift from the Lord,   That remains with you to share,
And when you think it's enough, there's plenty always to spare.
Anger will get one down, it's like a black cloud that won't go away,
But if we don't deal with it, anger will be in your subconscious to stay;
Anger can cause one to bring much strife more than you need,
So please deal with it first,  go to God,  and certainly plead.
