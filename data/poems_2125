//YOU DESTROYED ME//
To this day I am scared
Physically and mentally
These scars no one will see
People do not care if you are hurting
They see the pain in my eyes
From what he has done to me
But no one will ever see the physical scars
He came to this house and screamed
I remember that fear I felt
When he smashed his fists against the window
We all thought he would break them
Seeing him scream out insults at me
Then demand I take it back
I am lost for a reason
Of why I stood up for myself
I never have before
What he did that day
Brought me back off track
It took me deeper into my problem
Of cutting myself when times got bad
One day I will tell him
This is what you did to me
You caused me to hurt myself
And dream of committing suicide
I can no longer forgive you
I dreamed last night you ran over me with your car
I do not accept you as my father anymore
You are no longer a part of my family
You ripped me open and poured in pain
Then stitched me shut so no pain could escape
I am surprised that I once considered you my father
I'm even more surprised that once
I did truly love you
But that's all over now
