,                          HAPPIEST PERSON ALIVE
You are glowing, Louise, Juliette said,
yes you are, and why, I smiled because
the indelible memory of Rudi’s return
from his marine research trip will for-
ever be with me
I never knew that natural feelings and
animal instincts bring so much joy, I
never realized that the mere fact of our
existence and desires fulfilled bring so
much ecstasy
I thought I should achieve in order to
enjoy life and feel happy, now I discover
that doing what comes naturally is the
most wonderful feeling of fulfillment and
brings me more joy
Than anything I ever achieved or accomplished
the primitive urge to simply exist in comfort and
joy fulfilled makes me the happiest person alive…
