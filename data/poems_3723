NO ONE CARES
Bo one cares for other people's feeling
No one' cares's about phoning somebody and inviting somebody to come To his or her place
No one care's about making friends or reconection with friends
No one care's if somebody needs their help or not
No one care's if somebodyis sick or not
But they tend to care more about themselves more than other people
That is the humn imperfection that won't change
And if it doesn't change it will only get worst with the time
