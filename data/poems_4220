FEAR OF A LOSS
Ring, ring
That was phone,
Mum answered
In a moment
Lost in time
my mum was gone
Granny on the couch
Nervous, anxious, fearful
A Quiet, deathly silence
Filled the emptiness
We were told to pray
I dared not ask why
Praying, wondering, still dared not ask
Then the memory, gripping
Daddy hadnâ€™t come home that day
Fearing the unknown
Dared not question
Fear of hearing
Fear of knowing
Fear of loss
Ring, ring
Granny answered,
Questions, silence, gripped by fear
Bravely, she spoke what we dared not ask
What we feared we would hear
Daddy was gone
We lost him
In the silence of this night
He passed on, quietly
As he had passed through this life
Through our lives
The silence continued
Time had stopped
The heavy quietness
The ominous silence
Overwhelmed my senses
Fear
Loss
My fear of loss
No longer a fear
A reality now
