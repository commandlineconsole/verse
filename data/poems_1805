LOVE IS NEVER EASY
Love is never easy
So much to give and take
Encounters of the breezy
In its moments awake
Feelings to meet halfway
Surrounded by outside
Moon glow in another day
As those thoughts hide
Love is such a feeling
In its certainty and lie
Instant of pleasure stealing
In its tether and its tie
Wall that can grow tall
From echoes of mind set
Never again to make call
On its outside and reject
Love is all we are
In pleasures and learning
Inside deep and afar
Its ways are always burning
Rivers of times reaching
In its giving and taking
Always new ways teaching
In love of hearts making
