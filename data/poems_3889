DO YOU CARE
Do you care,
Do you no why,
Would you notice if I’ve gone,
Would you miss me,
I don’t think you would,
You never asked why,
I probably wouldn’t tell you,
But,
It just goes to show you don’t care,
Do you even no if I’m alive,
You’ve never looked at me,
Have you ever cared,
I cry,
I cry every night,
Everyday,
But you wouldn’t care,
You wouldn’t notice,
