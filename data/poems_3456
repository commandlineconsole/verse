SHE AWAKENED
She awakened with a start
Clutching blankets
Embracing her own heart
Up her spine runs a shiver
Her eyes open fully
As her body begins to quiver
Surprised and scared
Trembling
Unsure unprepared
Heart racing as it pounds
Attempting to scream
There are no sounds
Twisted mind slowly clears
Was it a dream?
That brought such fears
Sweat trickles from her brow
She is alone
Concern intensifies now
Sudden concern for her child
Bolting from bed
As she runs wild
Finding baby safe asleep
She sighs loud
She sighs deep
Relief began to cover
Still afraid
Worried for her lover
Was it nothing or anything?
She knew to cry
When she heard the ring
In tears collapsing on the bed
There had been a crash
Her husband is dead
