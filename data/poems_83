LOVE ME
Love me for real
Love me pass the sex appeal
Love me just like you love yourself
Love me until you have nothing else
Love me because I love you
Love me through the stress I put you through
Love me when it hurts so bad
Love me when things get frustrating and you get mad
Love me becasue I give my all
Love me when I make a mistake and fall
Love me when I'm wrong
Love me when I'm right
Love me day and night
Love me because I want you to
Love me becasue you heart tells you to
Love me becasue I love you
Love me and I'll Love you
