IN ALL THE CASES
No harm
If you keep calm
That will keep body warm
To hold against storm
If someone comes all abuses
With all anger and rushes
What should we do?
To pay in same coin, is that so?
I understand about immediate rage
It comes up like volcano with age
If you are young, you may prefer hard blows
Elderly people may watch calmly and go
Anger with anger
As if cruel behavior with stranger
It is not accepted in civilized circle
It may add fuel to inflame the trouble
“Pour bucket of water”
Head must become fully wet and turn like cooler
The anger is biggest enemy of mankind
Person engages in scuffle like blind
Sometimes it results into murder
Sometimes with injuries very severe
Ultimate outcome of it is bitterness
Enmity may follow endlessly in all the cases
