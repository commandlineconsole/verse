SIMPLE NEEDS
What do I need?
I need the words the most I think
I need some touch as well to live
I need a music around
I need some special climate
I need love, I think
Love in words
Love in touch
Love in the music
Love in the air
Love in your eyes as well
Love in many simple ways
You can give me your self
Love in the gesture
Love in your clothes
Love in your naked body and soul
Love in your favourites
Specialite de la maison
Love in your work
Love in your smile
Love in the way you speak
About everything around
Love in your mind
Love in your shopping tour
And I love to be in love with you
I love to share my life
With such a guy as you are
I love to give my self to you
I love to make love too
I love to do everything I do
And I love to live this way
With you.
