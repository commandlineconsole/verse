AN EID WISH
I hope that this eid will bring
All sorts of marvelous things
That you wish to see in the way
To increase the hours of joy in the way
For the days of joy really holds
Nice things for us that can mold
Narrow paths of joy at vast
Where happiness is given atlast
Where all our dreams of yesterday
Becomes happy reality of today
And golden hopes of our tomorrow
Washes away our pain and sorrow
So I wish especially on this eid day
Everything that will come in your way
May be full of all joy and cheer
Under God's loving bliss and his care.
