SIMPLY LOVE
All through life we seek to find
Peace, contentment – not far behind
The pleasure, joy and ecstasy of love
Like a beautiful white soaring Dove
Walking together hand in hand
Running, skipping through warm sand
Collapsing in a laughing heap
What joys of love are still to reap
A kiss, a lingering tender embrace
No matter what the colour or race
The freedom of youth so touching to see
Long years ago, that was you and me
But age can’t take away such love
The delight of seeing that soaring Dove
Real love lasts forever and ever
Still enjoying the timeless pleasure.
