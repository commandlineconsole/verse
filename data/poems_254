LOVE IS....
Love is the greatest gift of life
Love is the greatest bond
Between a husband and wife
Love is unbelievable
Love is humble
Love is a golden gamble
Love is life’s symbol
Love is mysterious
Love is hilarious
Its power enormous
Love is the greatest trial of life
While taking life’s test drive
Love is the single element
In any moment to hold on to survive
Love is smile
Love is a mother’s strength
Love is a father’s pride
Love is a friend’s support
Love is united kindness
Love is compassion
Love is affection
Love is the greatest joy of life
Give love, do not deprive
Without it, we shall not strive on!
Love is for friends
Love is for family
Love is for lovers
Love is for all
Love me for me
As I love you for you
