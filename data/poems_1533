MY PLEASURE
My pleasure in life
when disappointment stares ablaze
like a golden lotus
blossomed in  the pond of my heart
Thy pleasure in life
succeed all canon of my life
thy pleasure immolates
all delusion of my life
and my face is redened
with your sweet smile
I yearn just not to be aloof from you
Thy all agony decelerate
each action of my life
If you can not listen
screaming  sound of my heart
how can i say
