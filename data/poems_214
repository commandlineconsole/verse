LOVE IS
Love is special,
Love is kind,
Love is joyful,
Anyday or anytime.
Love is you,
You loving me,
Love is everywhere,
Love is free.
Love is given,
Never robbed or stole,
Love is precious,
Cant be bought or sold.
Love is me,
Me loving you,
Love is the heart,
Love is always true.
Love is giving,
Love is sharing,
Love is living,
Love is caring.
Love isn't learnt,
Love wont be fought,
Love cannot be fighting,
Love cannot be bought.
Love is forever,
Love is never ending,
Love is never stopping,
Love is always beginning.
Love is you and I,
Us forever living as one,
Knowing that it cannot be stopped,
And though GODS grace; will continue on.
