SADNESS
Sadness, sadness all around.
Sadness i wear a frown.
Sadness, sadness here to stay.
Sadness want to come play.
Sadness, sadness choking me.
Sadness does not flee.
Sadness, sadness all around.
Sadness drops to the ground.
Sadness, sadness does not agree.
Sadness is not free.
Sadness, sadness all around.
