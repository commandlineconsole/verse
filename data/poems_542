Passion, passion, passion!
The passionate principle of my love to my lover;

Every day i do pray and remember you;
Like in every movement of mine withouit you.
This is the passion principle to my heart,
This is the love that feels my soul!
My love, my heart and my mind are always on you;
For i have been missing you my sweet one.
My lover where are you?

And i have been thinking of you.

For every move i make is towards you;

You are still on my mind,
For your passionate principle are destined to me;
