MANNERS COUNT
It is your dress, cleanliness and manner,
Not your skin, countenance, and glamour,
That earns you a woman’s concern.
Your clean mind, clean teeth, clean habit,
Not your muscles, jewels and wallet
Are which earn you a woman’s concern.
Be your manner and calls above her reproach.
Refrain from over care and over indulgence.
Then you will have earned a woman’s concern.
You lend her your ear and not eye.
You tend her passion, not her lust.
You will have won her concern.
If you have no concern for women,
If you have no woman’s concern,
Then no use of you being born.
