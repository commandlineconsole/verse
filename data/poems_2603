REBIRTH
I have drunk from the cup of sadness
Drained from the angelâ€™s eyes
When the sadness in me dies I will be reborn
I have kissed the lips of death and despair
Chilled to bone left alone to the cold eyes of strangers
When the sadness in me dies I will be reborn
I have been a slave to sin
Craving, burning from within
Lost to the angry flame that is my name and my nature
When the sadness in me dies I will be reborn
I have seen hope leave
Faith deceive brave hearted believers
While liars and deceivers preach on
When the sadness in me dies I will be reborn
I have set free my rage from its cage
On my so called enemies
Sand found them to be reflections of myself
When the sadness in me dies I will be reborn
