I DON'T CARE
I don’t care about your fancy cars
I don’t care about all your scars
I don’t care that you once were bad
Or how many girls you had
I don’t care about the clothes you wear
I don’t care about the tattoos you bare
I don’t care about all those things
They don’t matter anyways
All I care about is you
Yes, this is true
All I need
All I want
Is you
