MEANS’ PLEASURE
I conceived many a time
But failed to deliver a baby.
It didn’t deny me the pleasure
Of having conceived.
I mated with him many a time
But wasn’t impregnated at all.
It didn’t deny me the pleasure
Of having mated.
He courted me for a long time
But it didn’t result in mating.
It didn’t deny me the pleasure
Of being courted.^
I was pursued by many a one
But to no one did I say no.
It didn’t deny me the pleasure
Of being each man’s darling.

Ends can’t rob means’s pleasure.
