THE UNKNOWN
See the thing with not knowing
There’ll probably be a surprise
But what’ll it be like?
Maybe worrying is unwise
After all it could be nice
A nice surprise?
Yes a nice surprise, my fortunes might rise!
Sky highs
Nobel Prize
Sensationalize
Perhaps there is a darker guise
To this here surprise
Danger could be lurking
It could be my demise
I’ll have to say my goodbyes
Cries
Red eyes
Dies
