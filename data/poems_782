SIMPLE LITTLE THINGS
Just from simple little things
Life's joy may often springs
So live with joy in each day
And make the fortune in your way
For kindness brings joy and shine
Just like soothing lover's wine
That brings contentment and fain
And shower like the summer rain
So go on and work on it
So it can give happiness in bits
For life's joy may often springs
Just by doing simple things.
