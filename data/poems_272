MASOCHISM
love cares not for my health
love gives me pain on the inside
love burns my stomach and cools my heart
love ruins my plans
love turns people into placeholders for me
love tells me to forget about everyone else; even the closest people
love forces me to worry all the time
love makes me throw everything away
love disregards my intent on staying sane
love wants all of my attention in return for the feelings it gives me
love lures the optimists and is the puppet master of the pessimists
love has good and bad at its disposal and for that it cannot be beaten
love does not heal
love punishes and purifies my soul
love keeps my wounds fresh to let me know I did not follow its rules
love motivates the lazy
love energizes the weak
love takes my breath at the thought of not being in my lover's inner circle
love becomes a welcomed thief
love will never let me forget her as long as I am living
love will surely come to collect its reminders and steal her from me when I’m ready to die
love staples my intangibles to the ground
love spells them out and puts them on display for everyone
Even she is in the audience and knows what love is doing to me.
She can release blame and say it's not her fault….it’s just that I am in love
