TURBULENT TANTRUM
Anger is more useful then despair
Dont cry your eyes out or pull out your hair
Smash someones head in with a wooden chair
Anger is more useful than despair
Do you think i really care?
Cant you see? I've laid myself bare
Please observe my frozen stare
Then look inside me if you dare.
