WHY CARE
why should i care
if your not here
and even though gave you everything i could have possibly given
its your loss not mine.....
even though my hearts gone and every shred of faith i ever had of you is gone too
why should i care
but the truth is i do care for you
i try not to
the thoughts make me sad
why should i care
you've never thought of what we could've had
dont you understand
i cared for you deeply
i cant believe you didnt see me and everything i did for you
but why should i care
its not my fault your heart is bare
cant you see youve caused my heart to tear
so why should i care
but the truth is i dont
not anymore
i always knew you had a good heart
but you always caused people to hurt
you just let it sit collecting dust leaving it empty
so why should i care you've never loved me....
