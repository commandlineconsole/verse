CHILDREN
Why elders orders children everytime
Can't they do themselves
Do't care, we are busy or spare
Why they totally depend upon children
Can't they do themselves
Do't care, we are happy or sad
Why elders always advise us early to bed, early to rise
Can't they follow themselves these advises
Do't care we want or not
Why elders have hard attitude
Can't they keep soft attitude
Do't care, what problems we have
Why elders interfere into our matters
Can't they understand our wishes
Do't care, we have equal rights
Why elders apply restrictions to us
Can't they apply to theirselves
Do't care, we need liberty
Listen boys
You are our future
I am favour of you
I appeal to the elders
To adopt postive and constructive
Attitude about children
