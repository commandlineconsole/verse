UNSOLICITED MEMORIES
Snow white memories, pure and unsolicited, flood my mind with  goodness and joy of the past.
Leaving my rhythm in tune with special emotions fitting nicely in a pattern of joy.
Taking me among realms of yesterday's subconsciousness, giving me an anecdote for the loneliness, emptiness, and abandonment I've felt through the years, filling me with all the things that have taken away my joy.
