DEEP WITHIN
Today, I want to ask myself
What is it, that makes me weak?
It is a monotonous day round
Or the fear I abound,
The fear of being a loser-
The fear of loosing friends-
The fear of letting the hopes down
The fear of not owing the winning crown
The fear which lets me down
Is the fear of being MYSELF
My feelings are strong & deep within
Which lay unscrambled & akin
They ask me to let them out,
Share them & clear the doubt.
Then I make a promise to find,
Someone who will listen to my mind,
Someone who will take me up,
Someone who will share the cup
Someone who will make me proud
& make me feel on the 9th cloud,
Someone who will say a word
& will complete my incomplete WORLD.
