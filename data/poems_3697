I DONT CARE
I don't care what you think
I don't care what you say
I don't care about what you do
You're no longer a part of me so I don't care
You're not my friend so I don't care
you didn't love me so I don't care
You can't take my heart away
You can't abuse me
You can't hurt me in every way
Cause I'm who i wanna be
Who I'll always be
Who I'm supposed to be so....
I don't care
