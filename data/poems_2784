THE HAPPINESS
The happiness
It's not easy to feel so happy every day
and not easy to full in it
It's came just for a moment
And we must know the sadness
to feel in it
No life without happiness
And there is no way to run away from the sadness
It's the rules of life:  day for you
And  day on you
some persons smile when they in the middle of war
Just to make the happiness
The happiness it's the important thing to complete our life
