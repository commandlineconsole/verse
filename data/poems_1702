PERUSAL
after a hard day
the day of the letters and convoluted thoughts
i glance upon the pages
of the virtues of
lust...smooth skins, beautiful lines
flowering into curves,
butts and in betweens shaved by the razor
of art, hairless
and so alluring to the hairs of my senses
my armpits giggling
my saliva excited so excited about what i can
touch in the mind of the
tired day...this is the start of selfish pleasure
so convenient
nothing to dress for
so cheap
after
it lulls me to sleep and dream
tomorrow i will be out again on a rough journey
after the pleasure
of my lone body.
