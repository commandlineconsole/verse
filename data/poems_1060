SONNET: ANTICIPATE WOES; LOSE NOT HOPE
When sadness goes and joy has replaced it,
Remember Man, ’tis just a transient state;
One’s happiness depends on how you’re hit;
Enjoy as if ’tis not your one life-mate.

Who knows how long the present joys shall last?
Ready thyself for flood of sadness’ might;
Despite one’s hunger, one must always fast;
Both joy and sadness keep your mind’s frame right.
A joyful state can last for days on end,
Nor sadness comes without some joy between;
Live life as if God always is your Friend;
Expect sad things as life is very mean.

Life will adjust no matter, what come may!
Each night will be followed by a new day.
