PLAYFUL
Fabulous dances and kids running
the flowers eyes studded with colourful delights
walking with the little legs
the paradise on earth for the mothers!
Loving fathers meaningful attires
in proud gathering their little ones
their pride in seeing their wife
cuddle in fond and kisses on cheeks!
The picture delight to write this poem
in fond and a potential picturesque
for me to hang in my abode....
