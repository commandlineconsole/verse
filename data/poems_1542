THINKING OF YOU*
here I am thinking of you again
you have captured a piece of my heart
of my soul
to keep forever
I want to feel your loving touch
to feel shivers of excitement run though my body
feel the drive for your touch
I want to see your eyes dancing
with every touch of my hand
the thought of us together again
makes me want you all over again
to pleasure you
would pleasure me
I wish she didnâ€™t see
it would have been so wonderful
to pleasure you once more
I wonder how many orgasms I could have given you
I wish you could have shown me just how sensitive I really am
