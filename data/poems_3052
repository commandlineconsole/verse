A LETTER FROM SORROW
inside i am ugly
nothing but darkness within
no beauty to behold
only sorrow to be shamefully told
inside theres no such word as god
theres no carefully written x's and o's on the letter of my soul,
but it painfully wrote
My name is Sorrow
my thoughts are morose
i wish to die
or stay silently in a state of comatose
i wish to be numb to the anxiety
i want to get away from the pain
i need a place to bleed
i wont eat
i want to get high
i wish i could sleep
i want to get these scars off of me
i want a door open freely to leave
i need a place,
