WHERE'S LOVE FOUND?
I thought this is love,
This sweet thing I have,
I thought this love is love,
And whom I love has love,
Until my love spoke love,
And said though I love,
My love meets no love;
So I beseech of thee:
Tell me the haven,
Tell me the den,
Where love is found -
The abode of love,
Better than this I have,
Better than this I love.
I believed my love is love,
A sweet love worthy of love,
This love for my only love,
For the lovely one I love,
Would meet passionate love,
O' I thought love is love,
And 'tis paid by love,
From the one I love.
Until my love spoke love,
And said my love is no love,
And it meets no love,
Not yet, not just yet;
Now I beseech of love:
Tell me the haven,
Tell me the den,
Where love is found,
Where you are found-
My love's abode.
