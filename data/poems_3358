TO WHOM DOES IT CONCERN
To whom does it concern that i migh love you or you seem so perfect to me, or that i might want to spend the rest of my life with you to share what will only be yours, to share my love and warmth, or that i might want to hold you and take the pain and hurt way, but to whom does that concern?
