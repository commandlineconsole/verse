WHISPERS
Whispers, they capture the silence by surprise,
Whispers, some are spiteful and some are wise
Whispers, they capture the silence by surprise,
Whispers, some told to girls, some to guys
Whispers, they aren't meant to be heard aloud,
Whispers, some are quiet and some are loud
Whispers, Whispers they are sometimes heard,
Roaming around you like a bird
