HELP THE EARTH
The end of times is already near
But most of us are not aware
There are signs that are happening
In the world in which we all care
But do we really care for our home planet?
Are we really concern about it?
We are still throwing garbage everywhere
We didn't even care that we are standing on it
Mother nature needs to be taken cared of
Just a simple cleaning will do
Let us help those people trying to save the earth
Simple people just like me and you
