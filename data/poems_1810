DARKNESS OF PLEASURE
Wondering of the bygone days
Thatâ€™s are not full of darkness
And not full of pleasure either
Remember the times we had together

But what will the new horizon bring
Back memories that I would die for you
Take your pain for you and
That is the darkness or will it bring
The future to me only the new horizon
Will tell me my future if it will be
Darkness or pleasure

I'm wondering what life will be
Looking forward to the new horizon
That moment when you said I love you
I remember when I said yeah me too
But maybe both to remind me of
What I once had then and what I
Can have now with a fresh start of life
