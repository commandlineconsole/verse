I AM SURPRISED WITH LIFE
I AM SURPRISED WITH LIFE
I am surprised with life.
Surprised by a morning sun
that leaps into the sky
from the mountains Darker side.
Surprised by unbidden thoughts
that burst with brightness
into a Mind I call my own.
Surprised by inner feelings
that rise – and fall – and pound
like waves upon some mystic shore.
Surprised by universal rhyme,
a circled rise and fall with time;
rhythm energies that bend
in time to rise and fall again.
Surprised to see
in you and me,
this endless flowing energy;
in cycle motion, encircled time,
an   endless   curving   curvéd   line.
For in the end there is no end,
we rise and fall then RISE AGAIN,
WITH CHANGING FORM
but dying never,
life goes on...  AND ON ...   forever
I am surprised!
Rhey W. Hedges, January 5,1962
