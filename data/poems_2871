MY GAZE SHIFTS..
My gaze shifts towards the East,
Where the black clouds loom over the mountain tops.
Thunder shakes the ground beneath my feet,
Not afraid to make it's self known.
Rain comes forth in gallons,
Creating rivers in the streets.
The storm now hangs above the town,
Creating a depression of boredom and sadness.
But within minutes the clouds disperse,
Letting the sun shine through,
Drying up the sadness,
Letting the day start anew.
