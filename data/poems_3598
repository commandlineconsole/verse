DON’T WORRY FOR TOMORROW
Day by day, must be my focus, this as I obey The Lord Jesus,
Living simply, one day at a time, obeying Truth, that is sublime,
Through the grace given by God, while I live on the earthly sod,
Knowing I’m sustained by Christ, as I live out this temporal life.
A command sometimes ignored, but, a deep Truth of our Lord,
Today has concerns of its own, as all tomorrow’s are unknown,
And concern about what’s not yet, just turns into worry and fret,
But our life we won’t fret away, when we obey Christ day to day.
If we only give God every day, Christ will help us along the way,
And not with tomorrow’s concern, as our Lord wants us to learn,
To trust every single day to God, as He leads with staff and rod,
For God knows all that we need, so just follow the Savior’s lead.
We must live one day at a time; this isn’t ours, but God’s design,
Not only is this more than sound, but, keeps us on solid ground,
And as we lean upon our Lord, an abiding peace God will afford,
All understanding this transcends, while His presence never ends.
So as His presence fills our life, we’re comforted by Jesus Christ,
Through today and into tomorrow, always there in joy and sorrow,
So today as we hear God’s voice, we really have only one choice,
Not simply just hear, but to obey, to live not tomorrow, but today.
