NO ONE CARES
No one cares for me anymore,
I have nobody to rely on,
No one wants to help me anymore,
I need someone I do not have anyone,
No one cares,
Why should I live my life if no one cares?
The lord cares that is why I am still alive,
I will live for the lord,
No one cares for me when I cry,
I donâ€™t care anymore of what happens to me,
No one cares but the lord.
