SHE
Through the depths of her sadness
and loneliness
she encountered
a range of boredom,
awe,
and even happiness from the different things.
She observed
and unconsciously
related them to her life.
She subconsciously
parallels herself
with the younger woman,
not knowing whether
or not she should admire her
she was old and unwanted
The feeling in her bosom is the sadness
It is obvious that the cry
is her own pain showing through.
