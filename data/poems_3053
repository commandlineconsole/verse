WHAT IS?
Love, Sorrow, And Death
what is love?
love is the sweet scent of roses
and the warm summer breeze
and your eyes shining brightly like the stars in the night time sky
what is sorrow?
sorrow is the darkest of days
and you walking away
and the dead look in your eyes
What is death?
Death is you
for you have killed this heart of mine breaking it in to tiny little pieces
for you have killed me
