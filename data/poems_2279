ANGER
Anger takes a hold of me and makes me what I’m not
It makes me say what I don’t mean to ones I know and love
My anger is so powerful that my body becomes an inferno
Boiling away and eating at my sanity and what little love I’ve got
Anger takes a hold of me right around the neck
It slowly begins to strangle me till there’s no compassion left
It turns me into an animal I never meant to be
I wish there was something I could do to tame this animal inside of me
Anger takes a hold of me and makes me hurt ones I love
It takes a hold of me and makes me hurt myself
It makes me love nothing more than shedding much more blood
Be it that of an enemy or someone I truly love
Anger takes a hold of me destroying my whole life
It takes away my sanity and leaves a monster in its wake
It takes such a toll on my health it’s eating at my soul I fear my time is spent
For death hath taken hold of me no that there’s no more anger left
This is to the ones I’ve hurt
The ones I truly love
The ones I never meant to hurt
I’m sorry...
