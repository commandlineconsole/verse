SYMBIOTIC WINE
Language of golden liquid
She drenches my mind
Validated like a lotus rain
Music sweet as an earth religion
Idolatry in her thighs
Wet dripping thighs
Flowing streams
Misty heaven in the mountains
Can chains be pleasure?
Bridled in unconscious dreams
Deep in the masks of pleasure
Ancient leather smiles
She calls me like a spell
Poetry in dark sultry tubes
Bliss calls in her curled toes
Nerve endings filled with silk
New Muse invades my blood
The sound of wolves like joy
I am hunted by my own desire
Crystal glass over flows
Symbiotic wine gold and warm
