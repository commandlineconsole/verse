ANXIETY OF FEAR
Though it only takes few seconds
It doesn’t make the burden in my heart
Less its weight
There’s always an unseen wall
That called fear
Fear of rejection
Fear of disappointment
Fear of out of control
Fear of unknown
Maybe it’s enough
Maybe it’s not enough
Maybe it’s should be enough
Maybe it’s never enough
Though I have confidence
Though I have lot experience
It doesn’t make my stomach not ache
Or my feet lighter
There’s always a cold feeling
That called anxiety
Anxiety of acceptance
Anxiety of failure
Anxiety of future
Anxiety of unreasonable
Maybe it’s right
Maybe it’s not right
Maybe it could be right
Maybe it won’t ever be right
