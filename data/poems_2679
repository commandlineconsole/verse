SADNESS
Sadness
My eyes tear as when the water falls down
My sadness comes crashing down around me
For me, my tears don't fall
Wraps around me, my tears don't fall
Plagues lead to death and that makes me cry when people die
Wipe the tears from my eyes, for the words I prevail, I will be heard
The sadness comes around me when bad things happen like death
Including suicide, and the chaos around the world
