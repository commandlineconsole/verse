FEELINGS
We all have two sides,
One good,
One bad,
It’s what binds us.
Darkness,
Loneliness,
Sadness,
Angriness.
Everyone has those sad days,
Everyone has those dark days,
Everyone has those angry days,
Everyone has those lonely days.
'Don’t come near me! '
'Leave me alone! '
'Get away from me! '
'Don’t look at me! '
Please,
Please don't hurt me.
Happiness,
Craziness,
Weirdness,
Love full.
'I’m always happy'
'I'm energetic'
'I will love you'
But please...
I’m fragile,
Don't hurt me...
