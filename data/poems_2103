T'WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS 2 (A CHRISTMAS PARADY STORY)
It was the night before Christmas and the Potter family were snug in their beds. Outside the snow was falling most beautifully. All of a sudden there came such a noise from the rooftop that Papa Potter scrambled from his bed to see what was the matter. Much to his surprise he heard 12 reindeers up on the roof.
Meanwhile, Mama Potter had not heard a thing, her snoring was louder than firecrackers, on the fourth of July.
Mikey and Twinky, had snuck out of bed and were much surprised to see Santa dancing in the middle of the bedroom. He was all dressed all in red and with a loud belly laugh he wrinkled his nose and disappeared to the roof, leaving behind 8 presents and stockings filled to the brim.
Papa Potter, blinked and what did he see? Jolly Old St. Nick standing right there! Papa Potter fainted and landed with a crash while Santa took off in his sleigh shouting, 'Merry Christmas to all and to all a goodnight! '
The next morning Mama Potter, woke up all alone and was surprised to find Papa Potter asleep on the roof. And the Potters had a wonderful Christmas that year, full of wonderful surprises...
