SADNESS
God’s wondrous joy, love's fruit of light
Gives peace a golden crown
Flooding the heart with awesome might
Casting enemies down
This law of life knows Satan too
He knows what children dream
He knows what Godly joy can do
And when it reigns supreme
Without; he knows a soul can die
Can lose it’s sense of grace
And so he’ll cheat he’ll steal and lie
Till sadness takes its place
Sadness can cause a power drain
Can hinder prayer on high
Till some turn God their backs again
And in life’s desert die
Sadness gives birth to foolish doubt
Can paralyse the soul
Can turn a righteous mind about
And hinder from life’s goal
Sadness is kin to gloom and grief
Despair it’s wayward child
Where only love can bring relief?
That joy be reconciled
The joy that brings a soul to sing
Dance with righteous desire
The joy that only Christ can bring
To set the heart on fire
So praise The Lord see sadness flee
Sing praise who understand
Love’s joy can set God’s children free
To dwell The Promised Land
