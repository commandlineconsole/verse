THERE'S FEAR IN MY EYES
No sorrows in my life
No enemies to fight
There are thousand reasons to smile
Yet there's fear in my eyes
Sweet dreams to see
Beautiful day to live
There are many reasons to love
Yet there's fear in my eyes
No fire to burn
No darkness to curse
No valleys to fall
Yet there's fear in my eyes
A Mother to love
A Father to care
A sweet family to live with
Yet there's fear in my eyes
All friend with me
No enemies far mile
There are all relations of truth
Yet there's fear in my eyes
Showers of blessings on me
All smiling faces for me
All words of love for me
Yet there's fear in my eyes
But what I fear for I'm unknown
What? When all these things will go
And I'll be left all alone?
And for all these things I'll have to say bye! !
May be for this reason
There's fear in my eyes
There's fear in my eyes
