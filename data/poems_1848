I'M BACK
I'm back,
I'm back  like never before,
I surprise the liers,
those who make us suffer,
they did that to me,
never to succeed,
I'm surprising the way I came back,
The liers that die in their sins,
I'm back and ever loving this life,
I'm back and telling myself,
This is the game,
I'm back never sleeping,
This is the awaiting glory,
I surprise the liers,
When I kiss the blessing throne,
Only the strong survive,
And I keep saying that I got to win it,
Let me win the hard battle for eternity.
