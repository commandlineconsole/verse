FEAR
Fear has no boundaries
Fear has no sound
Fear lurks all around
The fear of the darkiest room or place
The dreams that take place and fill withba savage face
The fear that lurks and scares the human mind to shiver and shake and make the very ground quake
It screams to you when you wake and teaches you to fear your fate
To eat your soul and turn it out
To grab your mind and smash it about that is what fear is about
