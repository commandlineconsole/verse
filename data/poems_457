lovers
embrace
destiny
what is love life sings
sexuality skin fantasy
flesh faces fabricates
violin vibrates screams
pulse runaway passions
sings slow spine chills
played under full moons
on rock of fractured destiny
gypsy siren sabre dances
lips ripe blood red roses
choice is whirling dervishes
undulating belly dancers
find me in dream destiny
in dream destiny find me
find me in dream destiny
whisper siren words
speak love promises
body soul rhythms
ask of me no frozen dreams
love swells on sensation lips
love bursts in passion hearts
