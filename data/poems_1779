THE MISSION OF LIFE
Life is a vain glory save love,
The laws of Karma, are hard and tough.
Attachment clouds soul,
And brings more suffering from sense pleasure,
Self benefits scale station, and fake is the pleasure.
Service alone with share to all,
Can stop one from his tragic fall,
For you are all living soul,
To know God in us is our goal.
