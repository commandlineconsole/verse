SORROW
I'm getting stupid day after day
drifting from the right way
stoped living by my way
stop following my ideas, also what I say
broke the rules,
closed the wisedem doors
entered a zone of a twilight
where I lost the perfect sight
tried to hold on to my fath so tight
tried to capture some hope
But fear is all in me
making me doubt what made me
sorrow, covered my light
sorrow, hide my direction arrow
sorrow, just sorrow
that's waht I feel
feel it since I saw that smile
a smile in the rainbow
sorrow
hunted me down
took my wil to live
took my will to lough
only that sound in may ear
only that could drive away my fear
only that could take away my sorrow
just that his voice in my ear
