RESTING IN THE CHURCH
It's been a long journey so far
And yet, so far, every step of the way
I've had to deal with minions of the undead
Whether in the sheer torture of the night
Or the quiet eerieness of the day
After braving my way through the woods
I finally arrive in a town
A place where I can buy many goods
And a place to fully heal myself
The townspeople tell me they go inside when the day ends
Because they fear the night
They fear the undead that wreck havoc in the town at night
With the night coming
The townspeople go inside their homes
I feel tired and I feel pale
So I head for the church
I walk through the door
Just as the sun goes down
I'm not concerned with what's going on outside
I'm not concerned with the undead making noise in this town
The priest welcomes me
And he notices that I'm tired
And that I look pale
So he leads me to a place to rest
He tells me to sleep and rest
And if anything else
He tells me I'm always welcome here
I feel truly blessed
Resting in the church
This church
