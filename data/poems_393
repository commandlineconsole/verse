PASSION IS A CRIMINAL
The whole Commission Of Romance
is a stitch-up joint operation by
Senior members of The Love Police
Who have ganged up to make sure
This our romance does not proceed
Lift your head and see who has come in
Thus old Passion is their star witness
Passion cannot be trusted my lady
Passion is a criminal and the full
might of the law must be unleashed to
Bring steamy wild Passion under control
Such mild measures like priestly
Intervention vis-a-vis their surveillance
Are bound to bounce back and fail
They are not enough to catch Passion
And convict him and give him his just
Earned and deserved life sentence and
Of greater importance is to arrest
him and without the lengthy to and fro
Frothy fruitless arguments of the jurists
We must hence and apprehend Passion
And set him adrift in the sea to find
His one way to the Dreamland of Love Land
And banish him there among the new lovers
And only thus will the new passion
Settle in our hearts and true love will
Come to us in the absence of the old flame
