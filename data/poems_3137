TUNE OUT FROM TIME AFTER FRANCIS THOMPSON ENVOY
Go, verse, unending is our brief sweet play,
go, offspring of light joys or unsung sorrow,
some heart-ease sow, tears wrung from yesterday,
whose fears unstrung, shall never know tomorrow.
Go forth, inspire, be fruitful, multiply
in minds of all who inspiration borrow
to turn a phrase which may Time's scythe defy,
while narrow spirits die, straitlaced, in sorrow.
Go verse, anonymous, but, mind, don’t stray
from goal to heal, feel whole, repealing sorrow,
reach all weighed down with troubles dark today,
teach each that reach finds happiness tomorrow.
Joy is no mirage hung in leaden sky,
nor shines reflections which before tomorrow
must melt from sight to leave a bitter sigh,
Tune out from Time and Tide immune to sorrow.
Enjoy the moment, shed care, every day
extends life’s jubilation though the morrow
may prove a disappointment on the way
from dark to dark - joy’s spark’s not promise hollow
but dream beam tiding over high and dry
shipwreck, thus is worth whatever follow,
as interstice amid time passing by
may offer scope to cope with season’s sorrow.
So go, verse, to rehearse this interplay
go, offspring of light joys or unsung sorrow,
go, candle burn in each and every way,
store tenderness against a cold tomorrow.
Allow soul, spirit, leeway to gainsay
those worried all enthusiasm’s hollow,
take all and naught for granted as the Way
unfolds for bold who hold no brief for sorrow
