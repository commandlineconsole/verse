YOU AND ME(SONG)
i dont care what people think about me
i dont care what people say about me
i dont care about anything around me
all i care about is you
the thought of being with you makes me happy
your voice makes me tingle all inside
your name gives me this feeling i cant explain
i love you and those are the only words that explain how i feel about you
i dont care what people think about me
i dont care what people say about me
i dont care about anything around me
all i care about is you
you and me thats how were ment to be
you and me thats all we'll ever be
both of us together as one forever
i dont care what people think about me
i dont care what people say about me
i dont care about anything around me
all i care about is you
you give me feelings i cant explain
you make me feel like i never felt befor
i cant seem to get you out of my head
i dont care what people think about me
i dont care what people say about me
i dont care about anything around me
all i care about is you
i dont care, i dont care
all i care about is you
