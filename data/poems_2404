THIS IS WHO I AM
Theres heart-ache where these tears come from. Attached to them a life time of hurts caused by too many hopes gone awry.
Theres heart-ache buried  so deep in this heart that its hard to seperate where the heart-ache ends and anger begins.
Anger strong enough to break through any kind of heart-ache.
Anger that paralyzes the heart to stone. Making it unbreakable to any heart-ache. Making it unbreakable for those that cause that heart-ache.
coupled with that anger is regrets and self-pity.
Drowning in them but at sinful piece.
This is what i'm used to.
This is who i am.
This is what i know, understand.
This all consuming emotion that builds day-2-day behind blu eyes that smile at every joke that goes bad.
