ODE TO PAIN
Nostalgeia; Why does the fondest memory
Make one bow his head and weep?
'Tis the memory we treasure-
Thoughts of expired smiles gone away
Hoping to return another day-
There is some pain in pleasure
I fell in love one April's eve
He was all I'd ever dreamed
And sincerely promised to leave me never-
But then came the night
He left me goodbye-
There is some pain in pleasure
O To find love, sweet love again
After the first love's bitter end
But in sick comparison is love measured-
Secretly one's heart is guilt,
Is it wrong to forget and new love build?
There is some pain in pleasure
Alone by myself is where I choose
Nothing to gain, but nothing to loose
Saddness my addiction, I play in the rain-
Crying and weeping, I feel so pretty
Swallowed up in my self-pity-
There is some pleasure in pain
