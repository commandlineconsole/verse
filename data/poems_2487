THE WIND
Like the wind,
you know it's there,
but its invisible to the eye.
~
That's how i feel,
i'm the wind,
there but not seen.
~
You can hear it,
it's cry's for help,
it's howls of anger,
but you can't ever see the pain it's in.
~
Just like me,
people,
they hear my cry's,
and howls of anger,
but can't ever truly see the pain i'm in.
~
Like the wind,
i'm invisible to thy eye's,
but heard through cry's.
