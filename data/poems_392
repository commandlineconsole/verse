NO TAKING MY FIRE AND PASSION
There's a fire in my eyes
a passion in my soul
that no one can quench.
This fire that leads my life
takes no pauses
this passion has ne doing
anything and everything
to do what my passion commands
the desires of my passion
are unquenchable and
uncontainable. you want some
of this girls free tough
you can't get none. you want to
take her passion away
goodluck. hahaha your
feeble attempts make me
laugh. There is no taking
my fire or passion too.
so not sorry and I hope you'll
one day find a fire and passion
of your own rather than trying to take mine
