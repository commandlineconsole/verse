BUNDLE OF JOY
oh sweet precious one
you are my little bundle of joy
a miracle sent from above
for me to give my love
a little babe in my arms
when once you were in my womb
a tiny little babe
new to this world secure in my arms
i will never let you go
even when you grow up
for no matter how old you are
you will always be my little bundle of joy
i've always wanted this chance
to be your mommy
this chance to hold you close
and feel your heart beat
in time with mine
oh my sweet little babe
life will be so grand and neat
with you in this world with me
i will always love you
my little bundle of joy
