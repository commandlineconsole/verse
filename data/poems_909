WEDDING
Today isn’t  ordinary day
The sky colored in other color
And
The earth isn’t the earth
Everything today is something else
Birds are singing with joy
And
The sky decorated and the moon lamp
All are  happy and joy even me
Today isn’t  ordinary day
Groom isn’t  groom
Turban and decorated dress
A smile in he's face
Knight sword in his hand
Ride on fly horse
Today isn’t  ordinary day
Bride sings today
Red dress and red lips
Anklets, diamond chain
And modesty Accessories Bride
Today isn’t  ordinary day
Today's wedding and joy
Wedding of My friend
