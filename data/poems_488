MY PASSION
The passion Iâ€™m throned
Is the passion I own
Cars it is for me all alone
Powered by an engine
Is what gets my attention
Floored with the very word
Is what takes me as high as a bird
Dedication and devotion
Is what gets my passion in motion
Beginning to start writing
Is what gets my gear shifting
Getting into full throttle
Is of prime importance
Along with that is patience
Getting yourself dreaming
Is what will get you gleaming
While my mind will wander
my strengths will grow stronger
Dreams in full momentum
will get you there
provided you are fair.
