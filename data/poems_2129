SILENT NO MORE
Super Dome, Super Dome,
site of pleasure,
site of sin...
you opened your doors
and took them in.
Then we saw their eyes,
full of death,
full of surprise.
Death for themselves,
surprise that none came to help!
America had to acknowledge
her poor, her poverty stricken,
her hungry, her lost,
her sons and daughters so poor
they couldn't even run to safety,
And so they died.
Not pretend,
not crime T. V.,
but real, true, with their life blood
flowing through their veins.
And the first thing accomplished
was passing the buck,
from mayor to governor to president,
each who claimed, 'Not ME! '
