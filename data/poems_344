IMPECCABLE LOVE
Love Love Psst Love
The grandmother of solution
Coheter of the scattered and deserted
Builder of happy relation
Amalgam of both sex
Love present,
Unity and progress continues....
Love Love Psst Love
I questioned what is Love
Billion answers goes
Fun, passion, sound emotion, ardor, sex,
Then many
These I accept...no idea?
For am a witness of distressed love
Love Love Psst Love
Someone plunder my love
b'cos of it am bored
Should I leave the plunder and search?
If ay!
I have to psych up
Nay!
Then I leave for search
Love Love Psst Love
The plunder had succeeded
The search I start
Now I will clothe like a violent psychopath
For man without love is derailed, distressed, dead
Life without love is noisy, odious, disheartened
Absence of love is absence of happy-joy
Love Love Psst Love
Now I can under'grab your emotion
Pardon for I have graduated from novicity
Love giveth life for success
Success giveth way for enjoyment
Enjoyment for happiness
Happiness for longlife
Goodfriends,
Forget not to love
Love Love Psst Love
It's a game for noviceand expert
Yes!
We all have our own statements on love
Past hurts I drop
For love is the first in breath
Yeah
To love is to bless intoto
Love Love Psst Love
Never forget to love for I will not
Past I pardon
The future love is impeccable
Love has no judge
Everybody is innocent
Am looking for a brand new love
A comforter of the past sorrow
Love Love Psst Love!
