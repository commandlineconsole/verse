MY MICHIGAN
What if the stars crashed into the sky
What if the moon forgot to rise
What if it were just you and I
No need for answers to questions like why
Because everything about this seems so right.
Its all truth when it comes to you and I
Start off as friends and end with you by my side
Want to know all about you from the inside
What you see when you close your eyes
What you think when you look into mine.
I’ll be there to dry your eyes
Cause with me there’s no reason to cry
I’ll find you when you run n hide
Baby without you I feel weak inside
Just realize with me there’s no surprise
So glad you’re in my life
Cause without you,
It was all just one big lie
One day just browsing by
Spotted you and had to say hi
5 months later the apple of my eye
Last thought at night
And the first as I rise
All about you
What a big surprise
Don’t even know you and need you in my life
When I talk to you my smile never tries to subside
Didn’t think it could be like this
Tell that day I realized
I need my Michigan by my side
