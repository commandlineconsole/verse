WHO CARES?
Who cares?
No one is watching
So for once,
Just let loose
Have your fun
Who cares?
I don't, you shouldn't and they don't
Don't worry about anything
Life will get ya down
But forget it and stand right back up
Who cares?
The world is made to be unfair
Beat the odds
Be unfair to it
Just let go of being strict
Who cares?
No one
Don't worry about a thing
Just have your fun
And get going!
