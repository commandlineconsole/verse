MY FEAR
My fear…
My fear is not yesterday,
My fear is not today,
For I have cited it

For I live it.

I don t know…
Is it bright?
Will it offer me good tidings?
Will I achieve my dreams?

My fear is not betrayal or trust,
My fear not death but its valley…
My fear is the end and pains...
My fear is my end.
