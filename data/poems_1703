THE HEART TOO ASKS FOR PLEASURE
do not underestimate the heart
it too shall take pleasure
it is not pure love
as gentle as the softness of the
cloud that merely drifts
upon the orders of the wind
it also know what pleasure is
so appease it with the wildness
of your love: crush it with the strength
of your loving arms.
