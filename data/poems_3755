BECAUSE WE CARE
Because I care,
I will dare,
To stand by you,
And stay there too.
Because you care?
That's not fair!
Stay with me,
Your my love, my life, my meaning, can't you see?
Because I care,
You cannot scare
Me away,
This, I know, I must say
Because you care,
You pull back my hair,
Gently brushing my cheek,
Making my legs weak.
Because we care,
I love you more than air,
You say you'll stay by me forever,
As I promise I'll leave never
