JUST PAIN
Laughter in the middle of a descending sunset
Crying in the middle of room for a fallen
Pleasure sure…
They all cause just pain
Sympathy and hunger
A broken nail, a broken bone and even a heart
Pleasure sure…
They all cause just pain
In the end
Pleasure sure it can cause pain…
What wonders beyond those closed never opening eyes of yours
Stuck alone in an empty house waiting for time…
Meanwhile just grief and pain remain
Pleasure sure it is anything
Pleasure sure can be given by anyone
But not by you anymore
All these memories have opened wounds
All these memories have…
Just pain, Just pain, Just Pain!
