WHAT IS PLEASURE? !
What is pleasure?
Sensual play with
A beautiful she
Or listening to melodious song of
The cuckoo on the tree
What is pleasure?
What is pleasure?
Understanding Einstein
Enjoying Shakespeare
Reading Krishnamurti, Aurobindo
Or feasting eyes with Picaso, Ravivarma[1]
And ears with Thyagaraja[2], Beethoven
What is pleasure?
What is pleasure?
Interaction with computer
Or sitting behind telescope
And watch the Universe
Roaming in space
Proliferating destructive weapons
Or swimming in the depths of Seas
What is pleasure?
What is pleasure?
Watching the rise and set
Of the Golden Sun
Or the rise and fall of
Mighty waves
What is pleasure?
What is pleasure?
Scaling the peaks of the mountains
Winning places in games
Ruling a Nation or amassing money
Or fooling the ignorant
And torturing the innocent
What is pleasure?
Can
Providing shelter
To the destitute be pleasure?
Can
Feeding the hungry be pleasure?
Can
Relieving the pain of
The afflicted be pleasure?
Can
Living in harmony without malice
With nature and fellow living-beings
Be pleasure?
Can
Annihilating
Destructive weapons
Be pleasure?
Does pleasure vary?
From being to being
Nation to Nation?
What is pleasure?
