'LOVE AND CARE'
You say you love me
You say you care
Why do you love me
Why do you care
I have done nothing for this love
I have done nothing for this care
But yet you insist on loving me and caring
I wish you didn't love me
I wish you didn't care
Because then I wouldn't be falling for you, Loving you and caring for you
