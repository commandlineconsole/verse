BE THE END NEGATIVE
If I don’t let you know that I love you,
Where is the pleasure of loving you, dear?
If I don’t get your consent to my love,
What is the use of my loving you, dear?
Even then if I pursue my love for you,
It is my faith in time and hope in you.
Even if I go with an empty hand,
I shall be thankful for the time I spent.
A game played would not rob the pleasure
Of playing, though with a negative end.
