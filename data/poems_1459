LIVE UNTIL YOUR DEAD
The ties that bind unwinding
The future needs reminding
That differences will always be
Yet pleasure and pain are the same to me
So broken on the inside, maybe the pain is what i need
Cutting on the outside, just to make sure i still bleed
With that pain comes the pleasure, that i am still alive
With that pleasure comes the pain, that my mind now needs to thrive
You live what you learn, someone very smart once said
So find some pleasure in your pain, and live until your dead.
